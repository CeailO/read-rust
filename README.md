## Development

First up: I'm sorry.

_I'm aware this involves a lot of dependencies. I had started building this
version of the site in Rust but paused that effort as at Oct 2019 the web and
async state of Rust was very much in flux. I picked Lucky because it was a
batteries included web framework backed by an ergonomic, statically typed
language that did not require a large runtime. In some parts I'm still using
Rust since I already had the code/it was easier for me. Eventually I hope to
shift to an all Rust code base but today is not that day._

My development environment for the site is Arch Linux and it generally makes
the experience straightforward. The instructions below are for Arch, adjust
accordingly for other systems.

### Prerequisites

* [Crystal] 0.31.1
* [Lucky CLI](https://github.com/luckyframework/lucky_cli)
  * [node] and [yarn] (for assets)
  * [overmind] (process runner to make development nicer)
* [Diesel CLI](https://crates.io/crates/diesel_cli) â€” install with `cargo install diesel_cli --no-default-features --features postgres`
* [Rust] >= 1.38.0
* [PostgreSQL] (9, 10, or 11 should be fine. I develop on 11, CI runs 9)
* [Chromium] (for running [flow tests])

The package list on Arch is something like this.

    rustup crystal shards nodejs yarn postgresql postgresql-libs chromium gcc pkgconf sudo make

Plus from the AUR:

* [lucky]
* [overmind] or [overmind-bin]

Additionally, due to [limitations in the Crystal compiler](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/issues/7514)
you need to build and install my little [striptags library][striptags]:

    git clone https://github.com/wezm/aur
    cd aur/libstriptags
    makepkg -si

If you've never set up PostgreSQL before, you will need to follow the
[initial configuration](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PostgreSQL#Initial_configuration)
steps. For local development with PostgreSQL it's convienient to have a role with the
same name as your username:

    sudo -u postgres createuser --interactive $USER
    Shall the new role be a superuser? (y/n) y

### Building and Running

Clone the repo if you have not done so already:

    git clone https://github.com/wezm/read-rust.git
    cd read-rust

Create `.env` file with configuration. You only need to change, `DATABASE_URL`
and `TEST_DATABASE_URL` to match the user your created above.

    cp .env.sample .env
    $EDITOR .env

Set up the database and asset pipeline (only need to do this once):

    diesel database setup --locked-schema --migration-dir rust/migrations
    cd crystal
    yarn install
    yarn dev
    shards install

Run the development server:

    lucky dev

After it compiles the site should now be accessible at: <http://127.0.0.1:3001/>

## Notes

### Importing From Version 1

    cd crystal
    lucky import_posts ../content/_data/rust/posts.json ../content/_data/{tweeted,tooted}.json
    lucky import_creators ../content/_data/creators.yaml

These are mostly notes to self (wezm).

### Resize Avatars

    cd content/images/u
    convert *.png *.jpg -set filename:name '%t' -resize 100\> -quality 60 'thumb/%[filename:name].jpg'

### Updating OPML

Download subscriptions from [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com/settings/import_export), then:

    ./script/opml2json ~/Downloads/subscriptions.xml > content/_data/rust/blogs.json
    make
    xmllint public/rust-blogs.opml

Some manual tweaks to the JSON might be needed.
