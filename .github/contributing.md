## Missing Posts

Adding new posts to Read Rust is currently a manual process and I generally
update the feed a few times a week. I read Mastodon, Twitter and
[Reddit][rust-reddit] as well as subscribe to a lot of RSS feeds to discover
new posts. Please only submit posts written in, or after 2018.

For all other posts [create an issue on GitHub][add-post].
