## Missing Posts

Note that adding new posts is a manual process and I generally update the feed
once or twice a day. If you tweeted your post with #Rust2018 it will be picked
automatically when I update the feed. If you post your post to
[/r/rust][reddit] I should also notice it and include it.

For all other posts [create an issue on GitHub][add-post].
