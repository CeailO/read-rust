The library implements a parser and writer for GBL firmware update containers, which are used to perform secure OTA updates for certain microcontrollers.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">aa59c999-cba6-4f20-80cc-888e8e257a73</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Jonas Schievink</dc:creator></item><item><title>The Seedling Sees the Light of Day: Sequoia-PGP Initial Release</title><link>https://sequoia-pgp.org/blog/2018/11/26/initial-release/</link><description><![CDATA[On October 16, 2017, we made the first commit to the Sequoia repository. Just over a year and a thousand commits later, Sequoia’s low-level API is nearly feature complete, and is already usable. For instance, a port of the p≡p engine to Sequoia is almost finished, and the code is significantly simpler than the version using the current OpenPGP library. We’ve also made experimental ports of other software that use OpenPGP, and written some new software to further validate the completeness and ergonomics of the API.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">5d14453d-3a6f-4f26-8aa1-20edec9e9347</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Nov 2018 10:08:17 +0100</pubDate><dc:creator>Neal H.

It aims to be difficult to misuse, ergonomic, and performant (in that order). It was originally created to serve the cryptography needs of Fuchsia, but we’ve decided to split it off as a general-purpose crate.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">b612b468-7306-4f7b-a09a-2b4f0bac5b55</guid><pubDate>Tue,  6 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Joshua Liebow-Feeser</dc:creator></item><item><title>Merlin: flexible, composable transcripts for zero-knowledge proofs</title><link>https://medium.com/@hdevalence/merlin-flexible-composable-transcripts-for-zero-knowledge-proofs-28d9fda22d9a</link><description><![CDATA[Merlin is a small Rust library that performs the Fiat-Shamir transformation in software, maintaining a STROBE-based transcript of the proof protocol and allowing the prover to commit messages to the transcript and compute challenges bound to all previous messages. It also provides a transcript-based RNG for use by the prover, generalizing “deterministic” and “synthetic” nonces to arbitrarily complex zero-knowledge protocols.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">2e26b090-21b9-42e2-9ac5-9664e79af88e</guid><pubDate>Fri, 28 Sep 2018 21:07:20 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Henry de Valence</dc:creator></item><item><title>How I’ve found vulnerability in a popular Rust crate (and you can too)</title><link>https://medium.com/@shnatsel/how-ive-found-vulnerability-in-a-popular-rust-crate-and-you-can-too-3db081a67fb</link><description><![CDATA[I have recently discovered a zero-day vulnerability in a fairly popular and well-designed Rust crate.

Its main focus is usability. This is in part achieved by providing a thorough documentation of the library. High-level abstractions are also provided, which are an attempt at guiding the users towards safe usage of the lower-level functionality of the library.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">96405556-ac98-433a-a0f8-c3de068e47d3</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>brycx</dc:creator></item><item><title>Security advisory for the standard library (str::repeat)</title><link>https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/09/21/Security-advisory-for-std.html</link><description><![CDATA[The Rust team was recently notified of a security vulnerability affecting the standard library’s str::repeat function.

What it doesn’t do is make encryption and decryption any easier than OpenSSL itself does.

Enter the cryptostream crate. Released on github and on crates.io under the MIT public license, cryptostream finally provides an easy and transparent way to add encryption and decryption to pipelines involving objects implementing Read or Write, making encryption (or decryption) as easy as creating a new cryptostream object, passing in an existing Read/Write impl, and then reading/writing from/to the cryptostream instead.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">2e015136-8213-4fa3-afe0-78bf520d1da6</guid><pubDate>Wed, 12 Sep 2018 23:35:55 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Mahmoud Al-Qudsi</dc:creator></item><item><title>How Rust’s standard library was vulnerable for years and nobody noticed</title><link>https://medium.com/@shnatsel/how-rusts-standard-library-was-vulnerable-for-years-and-nobody-noticed-aebf0503c3d6</link><description><![CDATA[Rust is a new systems programming language that prides itself on memory safety and speed. The gist of it is that if you write code in Rust, it goes as fast as C or C++, but you will not get mysterious intermittent crashes in production or horrific security vulnerabilities, unlike in the latter two.

That is, until you explicitly opt in to that kind of thing.

Their paper also describes a parallel version of their formulas, designed to execute four streams of instructions on four independent processors. Until now, these parallel formulas don’t seem to have been implemented in software. But a closer look reveals that slightly modifying the formulas allows the expensive instructions to be executed in uniform, making a vectorized SIMD implementation possible.

I implemented this strategy in Rust, targeting 256-bit wide AVX2 operations. The resulting implementation performs double-base scalar multiplication faster than other Ed25519 implementations I tested, and is even faster than FourQ without endomorphisms]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">8a924e9f-d803-4e85-b2e8-92b5909c7695</guid><pubDate>Wed,  1 Aug 2018 17:41:42 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Henry de Valence</dc:creator></item><item><title>RustSec Advisory Database</title><link>https://rustsec.org/</link><description><![CDATA[Security advisory database for Rust crates published through https://crates.io.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">db3cdc15-004b-4a41-9649-6ade4a8407eb</guid><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Rust Project Developers</dc:creator></item></channel></rss>
