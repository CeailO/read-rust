Adding new posts to Read Rust is currently a manual process. I read Twitter and
[Reddit][rust-reddit] as well as subscribe to a lot of RSS feeds to discover
new posts. Please only submit posts written in, or after 2018.

If your post is missing [please submit it][add-post].

## Providing an RSS feed

If your blog has an RSS feed please include a link to the feed when adding a
link to your post. This way any new posts you publish will be automatically
discovered.

If your blog doesn't have an RSS feed I would recommend adding one. It allows
people and machines alike to subscribe to your posts without having to check
back all the time. Most blogging systems have built in support for generating
a feed:

* [Coballt](http://cobalt-org.github.io/docs/rss.html)
* [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) â€” enabled by default at `/rss/` on your blog.
* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/templates/rss/)
* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/tutorials/convert-site-to-jekyll/#10-rss-feed)
* [Wordpress](https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Feeds)
