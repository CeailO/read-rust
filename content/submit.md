If your blog has an RSS feed the preferred way to submit a post is by adding
it to the list of feeds. This way your post any new post will be automatically
discovered.

If your blog doesn't have an RSS feed I would recommend adding one. It allows
people and machines alike to subscribe to your posts without having to check
back all the time. Most blogging systems have built in support for generating
a feed:

* [Jekyll](https://github.com/assafgelber/jekyll-rss)
* [Wordpress]()
* [Ghost]()
