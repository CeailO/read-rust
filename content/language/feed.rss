This DMA engine, unlike most other IO devices on the 3DS, actually has its own instruction set where the CPU merely uploads a stream of instructions for the peripheral to execute (other examples of this, on the 3DS, are the DSP audio processor and the PICA graphics chip).

I’d like to compile and run DMA instructions in Rust, in a hopefully ergonomic manner, without needing to use any dynamic memory allocation. This imposes a particular constraint that I need to know the number of instruction bytes at compile time so I can use an appropriately-sized array.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">433737c5-300e-4095-82c3-2ca05e51b029</guid><pubDate>Fri,  3 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Gui Andrade</dc:creator></item><item><title>Risp (Lisp (in (Rust)))</title><link>https://m.stopa.io/risp-lisp-in-rust-90a0dad5b116</link><description><![CDATA[Many years ago, Peter Norvig wrote a beautiful article about creating a lisp interpreter in Python. It’s the most fun tutorial I’ve seen, not just because it teaches you about my favorite language family (Lisp), but because it cuts through to the essence of interpreters, is fun to follow and quick to finish.

Recently, I had some time and wanted to learn Rust. It’s a beautiful systems language, and I’ve seen some great work come out from those who adopt it. I thought, what better way to learn Rust, than to create a lisp interpreter in it?

Hence, Risp — a lisp in rust — was born. In this essay you and I will follow along with Norvig’s Lispy, but instead of Python, we’ll do it in Rust 🙂.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">4ce6618d-d773-4260-85c6-639aaf6ec7fc</guid><pubDate>Thu,  2 May 2019 17:44:37 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Stepan Parunashvili</dc:creator></item><item><title>How XV uses Panics</title><link>https://medium.com/@chrisvest/how-xv-uses-panics-ba22bd6152a5</link><description><![CDATA[XV is a terminal hex viewer that I am working on. It is the first “real” Rust project that I am working on, coming from a Java background.

Java has exceptions. Both checked exceptions, identified by having the Exception class as a parent class, and unchecked exceptions, which have RuntimeException as a parent class.

Rust does not have exceptions. Rust has panics, which, depending on build-time configurations, are either catch-able when they unwind the stack, or only produce a backtrace, or just immediately aborts the process. This is controlled by the “panic” setting in the “profile” sections of your Cargo.toml file.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">0bc705c5-726c-4967-84cc-264f7a6338df</guid><pubDate>Thu,  2 May 2019 16:26:24 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Chris Vest</dc:creator></item><item><title>Cargo in 2019</title><link>https://www.ncameron.org/blog/cargo-in-2019/</link><description><![CDATA[I recently published a post detailing a vision for the next few years (hah!

That’s why developers have been building C/C++ extensions and integrating them with Python to speed up the performance. However, writing these extensions is a bit difficult because these low-level languages are not type-safe, so doesn’t guarantee a defined behavior. This tends to introduce bugs with respect to memory management. Rust ensures memory safety and hence can easily prevent these kinds of bugs.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">f759c500-da13-4765-81f1-dd59918b09d1</guid><pubDate>Wed,  1 May 2019 17:37:44 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Pradeep Chhetri</dc:creator></item><item><title>Stacked Borrows 2</title><link>https://www.ralfj.de/blog/2019/04/30/stacked-borrows-2.html</link><description><![CDATA[Recently, I have significantly updated Stacked Borrows in order to fix some issues with the handling of shared references that were uncovered in the previous version.

Being mostly familiar with untyped languages like Ruby and JavaScript, it’s interesting to learn a statically typed language and see how it changes how one writes programs. There’s a common misconception amongst dynamic typing fans that static typing means you write the same programs, they’re just more verbose and come with more restrictions. And while there is certainly a cost to only being allowed to write type-safe programs, a good type system actually lets you write programs you cannot write in dynamic languages. In Rust, generic return values are a good example of this.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">036c9563-3d69-4cf8-a59a-718976fded92</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>James Coglan</dc:creator></item><item><title>Things I Enjoy in Rust: Error Handling</title><link>https://blog.jonstodle.com/things-i-enjoy-in-rust-error-handling/</link><description><![CDATA[I’ve already talked about how I like how enums are used in Rust.

You can easily dispatch work to background threads. You can bring work back to the main thread. You can mark your classes as delegates and when you need to handle some event the OS will use a magic pre-existing thread pool to invoke your method and you can do whatever you like. It works perfectly almost all the time, except for when it doesn’t because of race conditions or it crashes due to concurrency. Life is good.

Rust is less tolerant about the crashing part. While I agree that crashing is bad in principle, avoiding it has significant ramifications for how you can write async code at all. Recently I’ve been finding out what the differences are. Obviously this means I’m more of a noob than an expert, but I’m currently in a good position to point out what the confusing parts are and what the Rust solutions seem to be. (But I’m a noob so take it with a grain of salt.)]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">0cc3f8b6-7cd9-423f-96f2-569b660e2bf3</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Apr 2019 19:30:00 +1000</pubDate><dc:creator>Thomas Karpiniec</dc:creator></item><item><title>Things I Enjoy in Rust: Enums</title><link>https://blog.jonstodle.com/things-i-enjoy-in-rust-enums/</link><description><![CDATA[I’ve been diving into Rust for the last couple of months, after my colleague started talking about it. I’ve been wanting to learn a lower level language, but C++ or something of the like have always seemed too daunting for me to even start.

I’d heard of Rust before, and great things too, but hadn’t set apart time to look into it. I finally took the dive. And boy, am I glad I did.

A lot of people talk about the borrowing system of Rust, or how fast it, or the strict type system. All of which are great things, but it’s not what I’m going to write about here.

One of my most frustrating experiences tends to always be around the futures ecosystem, as that's where I oft-fruitless labour for hours before giving up on what I'm doing.

I do data engineering and software development work professionally, and these 2 areas are where I often find a lot of pain with using the language.

A few weeks ago I wanted to write something that takes csv files and writes them to a database. I used Apache Arrow's Rust library (which I've started contributing to this year) to do that. The idea was simple, Arrow has a CSV reader that can infer schema, so I map the schema's data types to a database's types, and then I sequentially write records in batches to the database.

I found the exercise quite painful, so I'd like to talk about databases and Rust.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">ea9c3fbe-c681-4b42-a0ef-3699a1612972</guid><pubDate>Sat, 23 Mar 2019 02:02:56 +1100</pubDate><dc:creator>nevi-me</dc:creator></item><item><title>Rust All Hands 2019: Array iterators, Rayon, and more</title><link>https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2019/03/22/rust-all-hands-2019-array-iterators-rayon-and-more/</link><description><![CDATA[A few weeks ago, I had the pleasure of attending the second annual Rust All Hands meeting, hosted by Mozilla at their Berlin office.

Yes, strong typing prevents you from common pitfalls, and C++ can go quite far in this direction (as many JS/Python enthusiastic will gladly testify). It is often easy to forget how it sometimes prevents you from writing a completely legal and safe code, due to rules being too “protective”. And as Rust takes the code safety to a whole new level, sometimes a trivial code can’t be written, and without the proper knowledge, it might seem entirely arbitrary.

Rust programmers use the Box type all the time, but there’s a rich history of the Rust language itself wrapped up in how special it is.

In a similar vein, this series attempts to look at code and understand how memory is used; the complex choreography of operating system, compiler, and program that frees you to focus on functionality far-flung from frivolous book-keeping.
