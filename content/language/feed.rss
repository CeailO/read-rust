I have counted the lines of code for you. There are almost a hundred thousand lines of code in the Servo project. To develop such a big project, knowing how to debug in a right way is very important, since you would like to find the bottleneck in a fast and efficient way.

In this article, I will teach you some tips to use GDB developing and debugging your Rust code in the Servo project.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">fcadb47a-753e-44c9-830e-0e2cda34b365</guid><pubDate>Sun, 26 Aug 2018 14:55:42 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Liu An Chi</dc:creator></item><item><title>Easy proc_macro_derive&apos;s with synstructure</title><link>https://llogiq.github.io/2018/08/25/synstruct.html</link><description><![CDATA[Recently, I found myself in the market for some quickcheck.

The tag library of choice was of course, taglib-sharp, a port of the C++ library TagLib to the .NET ecosystem. Since Rust unfortunately doesn’t have its own native port of TagLib, and any C bindings available didn’t expose the picture API, the most obvious thing to do was to use the C# library with Rust somehow, right?]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">4a0db6c9-2c0d-4455-b353-474e4f59c87a</guid><pubDate>Fri, 24 Aug 2018 01:07:46 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Ronny Chan</dc:creator></item><item><title>Why an Interior Mutable abstraction is needed in the Rust core library</title><link>http://blog.kjeka.com/rust/programming/tmcl/2018/08/24/interior-mut/</link><description><![CDATA[Interior mutabiliby is a concept known to anyone who have programmed in Rust for a while.

In fact, an important part of the mission of the Unsafe Code Guidelines strike force is to deepen our understanding of what these invariants are.

However, in my view, there is also more than one invariant, matching the fact that there are (at least) two distinct parties relying on these invariants: The compiler, and (authors of) safely usable code. This came up often enough in recent discussions that I think it is worth writing it down properly once, so I can just link here in the future.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">7c167657-c185-479c-afc3-93b0187b8359</guid><pubDate>Wed, 22 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Ralf Jung</dc:creator></item><item><title>Another look at the pinning API</title><link>https://boats.gitlab.io/blog/post/rethinking-pin/</link><description><![CDATA[One thing has always nagged about the API we have right now though: the proliferation of different reference types that it implies. Today, the pin feature adds the PinMut and PinBox types, but in theory there ought to be a “pinned” version of every pointer in the standard library: PinRc and PinArc and so on. This is a very unfortunate consequence, but so far we have not found a good way to make pinning work compositionally - to have a single adapter that could be combined with any pointer.

Last night, a bit of inspiration struck me, and I realized that it is possible to make a compositional Pin type. This isn’t a fundamental change to the pinning model, just an API refactoring, but I’ve put a blocking concern on the proposal to stabilize Pin so that we can consider this possibility.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">edfe7063-b893-42db-aa08-61adcaddf56b</guid><pubDate>Wed, 22 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>boats</dc:creator></item><item><title>[blog series] From Rust to beyond: Prelude</title><link>https://mnt.io/2018/08/21/from-rust-to-beyond-prelude/</link><description><![CDATA[This series of posts is about those bindings, and explains how to send Rust beyond earth, into many different galaxies.

It’s memory management strategy is mostly the same, threading models are copied vanilla, both compile to native code and do about the same optimisations at that time, and traits and templates have a lot in common too. Both tend to be rather feature-rich languages with quite a lot to learn. While Rust is definitely better teacher (I’m looking at you, C++ error message!) and has many more „safety covers“ over the dangerous moving parts inside the engine, the design of the engine is more of an evolution from C++ than a completely new thing.

But I’ve noticed one rather subtle difference in the philosophy of the languages I’d like to describe here.

A popular way to add logging to Rust code is to use the log crate. However, the log create is just a facade, and by default the messages do not get emitted anywhere. The calling code has to set up a logger. Crates like env_logger let one set up a logger, during program initialization, that gets configured through an environment variable. This is a problem for librsvg: we are not the program's initialization! Librsvg is a library; it doesn't have a main() function. And since most of the calling code is not Rust, we can't assume that they can call code that can initialize the logging framework.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">d711d36a-fa00-4b26-a367-26b70589af2e</guid><pubDate>Fri,  3 Aug 2018 19:29:43 -0500</pubDate><dc:creator>Federico Mena Quintero</dc:creator></item><item><title>Rust and the Case of the Redundant Comparison</title><link>https://blog.dend.ro/rust-and-the-case-of-the-redundant-comparison/</link><description><![CDATA[A couple of days ago I landed my second pull request in the Rust Programming Language repository.

They offer a way to work with higher kinded types – a necessity in a couple of situations. A common example is the streaming iterator: an iterator able to return items borrowing from self (the iterator itself). Unfortunately, GATs haven’t even landed in nightly yet. So while are waiting, we can try tackling the streaming iterator problem without GATs. In this post we explore three possible workarounds for situations where an associated type depends on the lifetime of a &self receiver.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">2cc12b2e-22fb-461a-be01-ffeab54caa9f</guid><pubDate>Fri,  3 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Lukas Kalbertodt</dc:creator></item><item><title>Announcing Rust 1.28</title><link>https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/08/02/Rust-1.28.html</link><description><![CDATA[The Rust team is happy to announce a new version of Rust.

As I see it, there is no truer answer. The type system can be a seductive beast, often promising correctness and performance at the low-low, one-time cost of your soul.

Both parts of this statement are false, at least in languages with unsafe features like Rust or C: Pointers are neither simple nor (just) integers.

I also want to define a piece of the memory model that has to be fixed before we can even talk about some of the more complex parts: Just what is the data that is stored in memory? It is organized in bytes, the minimal addressable unit and the smallest piece that can be accessed (at least on most platforms), but what are the possible values of a byte? Again, it turns out “it’s just an 8-bit integer” does not actually work as the answer.

I hope that by the end of this post, you will agree with me on both of these statements. :)]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">b4133437-b69d-4491-a40f-a368a8847627</guid><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Ralf Jung</dc:creator></item><item><title>Building Readable Tests with Fluent Testing APIs</title><link>https://leotindall.com/tutorial/building-readable-tests-with-fluent-testing-apis/</link><description><![CDATA[One of the biggest challenges in software testing is defining the input for code under test in a way that is expressive and powerful enough to test complex situations but doesn’t distract from the intent of the test or clutter the test code to a degree that makes it difficult to read.

However, it also doesn’t hurt much and feels slightly better in many cases.

However, there are numerous edge cases and slight pain points, many having to do with a lack of known standard ways to do things. As such, many of the edge cases are likely to fall away as we develop after stabilization and come up with standard methods to work with the new feature.

The primary work to migrate is essentially just deleting ~all lifetime headers (<'a, 'b, 'c>) across impls and functions. More intensive migration would involve replacing untied/single-use lifetimes with '_ in all cases. This is quite hard to do from a person perspective (though compiler can likely do so fairly easily).]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">ea8d1190-c763-4f38-8181-1fc86193bfe4</guid><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Mark Rousskov</dc:creator></item><item><title>Thoughts on Compile-Time Function Evaluation and Type Systems</title><link>https://www.ralfj.de/blog/2018/07/19/const.html</link><description><![CDATA[For some time now (since the 1.26 release, to be precise), Rust has a very powerful machinery for CTFE, or compile-time function evaluation.

There is no good answer to this question because this comparison is unfounded.

Moreover, both languages are supposed to focus on systems software.

What is so great about channels vs shared mutable state? One thing is, it makes it easier to reason about how various threads will synchronize their behavior as they go on about their business.

The way it’s done in Servo is by combining event-loops with multi-threading/processing. What does that mean?]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">fa4c6fb5-3c9e-4831-86b1-3585c08398de</guid><pubDate>Thu, 28 Jun 2018 05:17:48 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Gregory Terzian</dc:creator></item><item><title>Signal Hook: Unix signal hanadling in Rust</title><link>https://vorner.github.io/2018/06/28/signal-hook.html</link><description><![CDATA[As promised in the previous article (thanks for all the valuable feedback ‒ I didn’t have the time to act on it yet, but I will), this talks about Unix signal handling.

Despite its relatively young age, Rust has been voted the “most loved” language in the StackOverflow developer survey every one of those three years - an impressive feat!

However, it’s not enough for a language to be well liked: the programming ecosystem changes rapidly, and many of these developers are rightly afraid to jump blindly onto the latest bandwagon. We chose Rust not because it is popular, but because we believe it is the best tool for the job we have to do, and I hope to explain that reasoning now.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">e9ac81fa-8018-4bb1-91a2-cfd0b705f780</guid><pubDate>Tue, 26 Jun 2018 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>PassFort</dc:creator></item><item><title>A Rusty Go at Channels</title><link>https://gsquire.github.io/static/post/a-rusty-go-at-channels/</link><description><![CDATA[Channels Channels are a useful concurrency primitive that enable separate processes to safely communicate without the need for explicit synchronization. The term processes is used here to loosely describe independent threads of execution within a program. This can be an OS level thread or a runtime level thread. Channels can be seen as a pipe to connect these processes and allow them to share memory with one another. For example a program could spawn any number of processes along with a channel to transmit results that it gathers.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">0a781f91-aca4-47ac-81d4-f9f606f33d0f</guid><pubDate>Sun, 24 Jun 2018 10:44:31 -0700</pubDate><dc:creator>Garrett Squire</dc:creator></item><item><title>Compiler fuzzing, part 1</title><link>http://www.vegardno.net/2018/06/compiler-fuzzing.html</link><description><![CDATA[Much has been written about fuzzing compilers already, but there is not a lot that I could find about fuzzing compilers using more modern fuzzing techniques where coverage information is fed back into the fuzzer to find more bugs.

At its best, the RFC offers an opportunity for collaborative design that is really exciting to be a part of. At its worst, it can devolve into bickering without any real motion towards consensus. If you’ve not done so already, I strongly recommend reading aturon’s excellent blog posts on this topic.

The RFC process has also evolved somewhat organically over time.

While age is usually indicative of mature implementations with decades of optimization under their belts, it also means that the language's feature set is mostly devoid of modern advancements in programming language design. For that reason, you see a great deal of encouragement nowadays to move to newer languages - they're designed with contemporary platforms in mind, rather than working within the limitations of platforms like the PDP-11. Among said "new languages" are Zig, Myrddin, Go, Nim, D, Rust.. even languages like Java and Elixir that run on a virtual machine are occasionally suggested as alternatives to the AOT-compiled C and C++.

I have plans to look into the characteristics that distinguish each and every one of these new programming languages, learning them and documenting my first impressions in the form of blog posts.
