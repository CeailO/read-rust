Maybe, they are truly Rust&apos;s Monads. Let&apos;s talk about what they are, where you encounter them and then how to get competent with them.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">c0b3d7ad-673f-4eb9-aa54-45447d1eafb0</guid><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jan 2018 15:30:00 +0100</pubDate><dc:creator>Florian Gilcher</dc:creator></item><item><title>Introduction to Procedural Macros</title><link>https://tinkering.xyz/posts/introduction-to-proc-macros/</link><description>As a newcomer to Rust, I heard the phrase “procedural macro” thrown around a lot without really understanding what it meant. I figured that I would learn about them if I ever needed them. Well, I’m working on the guts of relm, and a large chunk of it is procedural macros.

In the second post, we narrowed down exactly what problem we need to solve to make generators work, and talked about some solutions that we’ve considered but don’t feel like we could ship in the near future.
In the original post, I promised that I would have a near term solution by the end of this series.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">25060712-7d38-4492-991d-a52a9111891c</guid><pubDate>Sun,  4 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>boats</dc:creator></item></channel></rss>
