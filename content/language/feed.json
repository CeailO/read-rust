Better suited to my needs than Python, but too far away from the developer experience I was enjoying when doing Elm in the frontend. So I gave Rust a try.",

I'm looking over at you JS, Java, and Ruby devs. I'd bet most neckbea.. *cough, excuse me, C developers are comfortable with these issues but alas, I am not.

Mostly it would let me eliminate boilerplate while also improving correctness, and making the code a bit shorter. So, that got me thinking: What would this look like if I could use external packages?

      "content_text": "I did not plan to write this blog post. I thought that the fourth post in my series would explain how we could go from the generator API in my previous post to a futures API in which you don’t have to heap allocate every async call. But eddyb surprised me, and now I have to revisit the API in the previous post, because we can implement everything we need from immovability with a safe interface afterall.",

Maybe, they are truly Rust's Monads. Let's talk about what they are, where you encounter them and then how to get competent with them.",

I figured that I would learn about them if I ever needed them. Well, I’m working on the guts of relm, and a large chunk of it is procedural macros. I’ve learned enough about procedural macros to be dangerous, so I thought I would pass on some knowledge.",

In the second post, we narrowed down exactly what problem we need to solve to make generators work, and talked about some solutions that we’ve considered but don’t feel like we could ship in the near future.\nIn the original post, I promised that I would have a near term solution by the end of this series.",
