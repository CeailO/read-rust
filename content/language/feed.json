Each one will talk about a particular error that I got recently and try to explain (a) why I am getting it and (b) how I fixed it. The purpose of this series of posts is partly to explain Rust, but partly just to gain data for myself. I may also write posts about errors I’m not getting – basically places where I anticipated an error, and used a pattern to avoid it. I hope that after writing enough of these posts, I or others will be able to synthesize some of these facts to make intermediate Rust material, or perhaps to improve the language itself.",

Despite the severity of these risks, software continues to be written for safety-critical applications in languages that permit common classes of failures, such as undefined behavior, state corruption, and unexpected termination. One such language is C. Language standards that define allowable subsets (e.g. MISRA) and static analysis tools are often used in an attempt to ameliorate these failures by detecting them in the program code before they result in a critical issue at runtime. These traditional methods are ultimately insufficient when it comes to providing ahead-of-time assurances about safe runtime behavior for safety-critical applications. Alternative approaches must be considered.",

That very same principle, event-driven I/O, is the same reason I chose Node.js for most of the APIs I’ve developed since 2011. Even if practices change, we retain successful engineering models.\n\nBeginning late last year, as I sketched our founding mission and initial product offerings, I also decided to select a new primary language that could handle most of our primary development tasks.

While we have been using Rust before it now feels different because the ecosystem is so much more stable and we ran less against language or tooling issues.\n\nHowever talking to people new to Rust (and even brainstorming APIs with coworkers) it's hard to get rid of the feeling that Rust can be a mind bending adventure and that the best way to have a stress free experience is knowing upfront what you cannot (or should not attempt to) do. Knowing that certain things just cannot be done helps putting your mind back back on the right track.\n\nSo here are things not to do in Rust and what to do instead which I think should be better known.",

One is to restrict the programming language and disallow pointers. But, this forces most programs to make unnecessary copies of data. Another strategy, called garbage collection, embeds a garbage collector with every program. The garbage collector periodically looks for objects in memory that cannot be accessed from the program and reclaims this memory. The drawbacks of this are the overhead of garbage collection and that deallocation of memory is no longer under the control of the programmer.",

Furthermore, there isn’t just one RAM, but each memory location can live in different caches at each time and some of them are private to each CPU.

This post is aimed at helping other fledgling rust-learners avoid my mistake. First, by helping Rust learners pick good introductory projects that will fit naturally in idiomatic rust. Second, by helping Rust learners start building Rust-friendly design intuition. I’d heard about Rust and it’s inscrutable borrow checker for years, but after reading a few blog posts about compiler error improvements, I figured it might be user-friendly enough to give it a try.",

However, both taking owneship of a value (moving it) or taking a reference to it can only happen after the value was created. This ordering seems to prevent having any cycle in a data structure, even though that’s sometimes useful or necessary. For example in a web page’s content tree, from any DOM node, one can easily access (if any) its first and last child, previous and next sibling, (so children of a node form a doubly-linked list) and parent. Some other applications might need to manipulate arbitrary graphs in their full generality.",

As I said back then: I held myself to the same constraints as the original contest; no external packages is a bit painful in Rust, but it’s not too bad. Mostly it would let me eliminate boilerplate while also improving correctness, and making the code a bit shorter. So, that got me thinking: What would this look like if I could use external packages? I took about an hour, and knocked it out. I have two versions to show you today, one where I pay no attention to allocations, and one where it’s zero-allocation.",

I decided to scratch that itch: I wrote ppbert, a command-line utility that reads BERT-encoded values and pretty-prints them. I’ve worked sporadically on ppbert for almost a year now, I use it daily at work, I’m happy with it, and I want to write about some of the things I learned during that journey.",
