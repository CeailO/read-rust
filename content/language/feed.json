Immediately after that, eddyb showed me a better interface, which I described in the next post. Now, to tie everything together, its time to talk about how we can integrate this into the futures ecosystem. Starting point: this Generator API To begin, I want to document the generator API I’ll be using in this post, which is roughly what followed from my previous post:",

      "content_text": "I did not plan to write this blog post. I thought that the fourth post in my series would explain how we could go from the generator API in my previous post to a futures API in which you don’t have to heap allocate every async call. But eddyb surprised me, and now I have to revisit the API in the previous post, because we can implement everything we need from immovability with a safe interface afterall.",

I figured that I would learn about them if I ever needed them. Well, I’m working on the guts of relm, and a large chunk of it is procedural macros. I’ve learned enough about procedural macros to be dangerous, so I thought I would pass on some knowledge.",

In the second post, we narrowed down exactly what problem we need to solve to make generators work, and talked about some solutions that we’ve considered but don’t feel like we could ship in the near future.\nIn the original post, I promised that I would have a near term solution by the end of this series.",
