Rust macros are a great feature that can reduce code boilerplate and be a time saver for programmers. They also offer flexibility for developers to use metaprogramming to add new features to the language and package them in a way that is easy to integrate into code. They are one of the more powerful features of the language and this led me to search github and cargo to see what was out there. Below are some interest macros that are not as well known.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">b2657146-974b-41b9-ba31-8aae62c25f7d</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Apr 2019 02:00:39 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Ben McDonald</dc:creator></item><item><title>splines-1.0.0 and first release candidate</title><link>https://phaazon.net/blog/splines-1.0.0-rc.1</link><description><![CDATA[today, I’m going to talk about the splines crate. And more specifically, the splines-1.0.0-rc.1 release candidate I uploaded today on crates.io. Maybe you’re wondering what a spline is, in the first place. A spline is a mathematic curve that is defined by several polynomials. You can picture them mentally by several small and simple curves combined to each others, giving the curve an interesting shape and properties. Now why we want splines is easy to understand: imagine a curve, something smooth and a bit complex (maybe even with loops). Now, imagine you want to make an object move along that curve. How do you represent that curve and how to you “make something advance along it?”]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">50725324-0ca7-4137-8e95-9d5e023881f8</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Apr 2019 01:10:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Dimitri Sabadie</dc:creator></item><item><title>12 Killer Rust Libraries You Should Try</title><link>https://medium.com/@jondot/12-killer-rust-libraries-you-should-know-c60bab07624f</link><description><![CDATA[I’ve just crossed a 20K LOC in one of my bigger Rust projects, and thought about pausing for a moment and sharing some great Rust libraries that I’ve used.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">b8b79bb1-c176-43e8-bad9-943285e361c6</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Apr 2019 15:21:32 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Dotan Nahum</dc:creator></item><item><title>Runtime</title><link>https://blog.yoshuawuyts.com/runtime/</link><description><![CDATA[The vision of the Async Ecosystem WG is to refine the async Rust experience until it matches the quality and ease of working with today's std.

I don't know what to call it, but there is this itch I have when I find something that can obviously be made more efficient. The way I get about scratching that itch these days is by writing some Rust. I just got such an itch when looking at static site generators for this blog, Hugo (written in Go) is pretty much state-of-the art. In Rust land we have Zola, which is feature-rich, mature (for v0.5), and definitely fast enough for most users, and yet it is not as fast as it could be. Being written in Rust is, by itself, not a guarantee of top performance. The implementation matters. After some looking around I've narrowed down a problem I want to tackle (for now) to one area: template engines.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">a540ae81-ddbb-4279-a507-b7faf43e5b19</guid><pubDate>Sun,  3 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Maciej Hirsz</dc:creator></item><item><title>The last two months in rustsim #4 (January - February 2019)</title><link>https://www.rustsim.org/blog/2019/03/01/this-month-in-rustsim/</link><description><![CDATA[Welcome to the fourth edition of This month in rustsim.

But currently there’s not a huge selection of resources showing how to get started with WebAssembly, and I couldn’t find any tutorials that worked with create-react-app. Most focus on writing and compiling a module, but rush over the details of actually using Wasm code.

First, with the help of Fernando Jiménez, we finished what my colleague Philippe Normand and Sebastian Dröge (one of my programming heroes) started: a media player in Rust designed to be integrated in Servo. This media player lives in its own crate: servo/media along with the WebAudio engine. A crate, in Rust jargon, is like a library. This crate is (very ad-hocly) designed to be multimedia framework agnostic, but the only backend right now is for GStreamer. Later we integrated it into Servo adding an initial support for audio and video tags.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">3697f091-2478-437f-bdbb-3e464fe1ab8a</guid><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jan 2019 19:42:55 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>vjaquez</dc:creator></item><item><title>proc-macro-rules - macro_rules-like pattern matching inside a procedural macro</title><link>https://www.ncameron.org/blog/proc-macro-rules/</link><description><![CDATA[I'm announcing a new library for procedural macro authors: proc-macro-rules (and on crates.io).

Layout is fundamental to any UI application. The layout engine is what takes a set of rules and figures out where to place elements on the screen. This sounds simple enough but as UIs become increasingly complex we rely more on the layout engine to be able to create these UIs as easily as possible. Not only should it be easy to build these UIs but the engine performing this work is also required to do so at minimum cost as it runs possibly on every frame (for example when performing layout animations).]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">cdb3ed72-c1a4-4ff2-8350-cb5768fd96d4</guid><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jan 2019 20:04:57 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Emil Sjölander</dc:creator></item><item><title>Rutie: “The Tie Between Ruby and Rust.”</title><link>https://github.com/danielpclark/rutie/blob/master/README.md</link><description><![CDATA[Integrate Ruby with your Rust application.

This is something I’ve been fighting with a lot, especially while working on my SAT solver varisat. Around the time Niko Matsakis published his blog post about this, I realized that the existing workarounds I’ve been using in varisat have become a maintenance nightmare. Making simple changes to the code required lots of changes in the boilerplate needed to thread various references to the places where they’re needed.

While I didn’t think that a new language feature to solve this would be something I’d be willing to wait for, I decided to sit down and figure out how such a language feature would have to look like. I knew that I wanted something that allows for partial borrows across function calls. I also prefer this to work with annotations instead of global inference. While trying to come up with a coherent design that fits neatly into the existing type and trait system, I realized that most of what I wanted can be realized in stable rust today.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">2508ab68-2b48-4066-a6b4-a15a4f061025</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Dec 2018 14:07:10 +0100</pubDate><dc:creator>Jannis Harder</dc:creator></item><item><title>A great 2018, an even better 2019</title><link>https://tokio.rs/blog/2018-12-recap-2018/</link><description><![CDATA[A year ago, Tokio was a very different library.

A lot of this work is spent with larger amounts of data in order to implement the batch layer of the Lambda architecture. Due to this, the largest concern is that the behaviour is consistent across both the batch layer and the realtime layer - naturally you wouldn't want sporadic behaviour across the two. The easiest way to do this is to share code across the layers, to avoid having to keep implementations in sync. We have recently been working with Rust, which has been a little difficult to integrate with Hadoop MapReduce flows due to the fact it's mainly written in Java. It's because of this that I began to work on a small library named Efflux. It's designed as a very small interface to the MapReduce pattern, and implemented in Rust to allow us to share code across the batch layer easily.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">00a3f85a-45c7-42b3-8fac-605dcb945229</guid><pubDate>Wed, 28 Nov 2018 07:00:49 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Isaac Whitfield</dc:creator></item><item><title>Thessaloniki GNOME+Rust Hackfest 2018</title><link>https://people.gnome.org/~federico/blog/thessaloniki-gnome-rust-2018.html</link><description><![CDATA[A couple of weeks ago we had the fourth GNOME+Rust hackfest, this time in Thessaloniki, Greece.
