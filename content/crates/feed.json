Just one more cool project I couldnâ€™t afford to take on. But as things go, my interest in mutation testing was rekindled, and I decided to give it a shot and do more than blogging about it.",

Highlights of this release include: Correct, semantic use of mutability, GTK+ theme application per window, and menu bars and file open/create modal support.",

If you stick a #[derive(Deserialize, Serialize)] on your struct, Bincode can efficiently serialize and deserialize those structs to and from bytes. Bincode is unique in that itâ€™s a format that was built specifically for the Rust serialization ecosystem. Tight coupling with Serde allows Bincode to be very fast and serialize to very small payloads.",

While the focus was to make tql work on the stable version of the compiler, I also added some new features. The most notable new feature is the support for SQLite: now tql supports SQLite as well as PostgreSQL. The support for SQLite is almost as complete as the one for PostgreSQL: the only missing function is not implemented because the backend (SQLite) does not support it.",

I believe it is starting to be useful, so I wrote this description to show what it is good for and how it fits into the big picture of Rust. Thereâ€™ll be some more changes, though, at least because Tokio just released a new version (and Futures plan to do so soon), so Corona will have to adapt.",

I first announced version 3 of Combine back in August and back then I definitely expected to have a stable version by now. However other projects (cough gluon cough) got in the way and Combine fell to the wayside. It didnâ€™t help that I didnâ€™t have a killer feature for 3.0 either, user-defined error types make it possible to define parsers usable in #[no_std] crates which is great when you need it but it is still a fairly niche use-case.",

It provides precise measurements of changes in the performance of benchmarked code, and gives strong statistical confidence that apparent performance changes are real and not simply noise. Clear output, a simple API and reasonable defaults make it easy to use even for developers without a background in statistics. Unlike the benchmarking harness provided by Rust, Criterion.rs can be used with stable versions of the compiler.",

Writing an explicit AVX2-accelerated version of baseðŸ’¯'s encoder and decoder, then realizing I'd have to do the same thing again to see the speedups on my Ivy Bridge desktop, pushed me to make this library. Months later, it has blossomed into its own project, and has eclipsed baseðŸ’¯ in both popularity and promise.",
