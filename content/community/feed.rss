Note that our meetups usually run 2-4 hours, but some attendees may have to join late or leave early so the format has to take this into account.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">8cf7d62c-c8d9-4116-ae4c-7ac155d015cb</guid><pubDate>Wed,  8 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Llogiq</dc:creator></item><item><title>Sustainability</title><link>https://yakshav.es/sustainability/</link><description><![CDATA[I’m at a fork again: my FOSS project responsibilities have grown so much that they encroach on other parts of my life. This includes time I should spend with company, clients and personal live. It leaves me with two options: shed many of my projects (as mxsash does) or find ways of making this more sustainable. Retreating would also mean that on the surviving projects, others would have to cover the resulting gap, often with less skills or experience.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">0e7e0d63-d08d-4b38-812b-d67b5b7f9d43</guid><pubDate>Tue, 26 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Florian Gilcher</dc:creator></item><item><title>Musing About Communities Size And Activity</title><link>https://ervin.ipsquad.net/2018/06/22/musing-about-communities-size-and-activity/</link><description><![CDATA[I wanted to take a very quick peak at Rust. It's very different from our previous cases, no application or frameworks in the traditional sense but a language. It seems very popular toward developers using it, I'm personally interested in it hence why it is in that post.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">85a6b729-6bb3-4dc0-9a15-80ba9ff44f68</guid><pubDate>Fri, 22 Jun 2018 19:36:00 +0200</pubDate><dc:creator>Kevin Ottens</dc:creator></item><item><title>Increasing Rust&apos;s Reach 2018 Prticipants</title><link>http://reach.rust-lang.org/2018/participants</link><description><![CDATA[This year's class of Increasing Rust's Reach participants span 9 timezones and 11 countries. 64% are non-native English speakers, and the group, as a whole, represents fluency in 14+ languages.

My path to Rust certainly is not typical (I studied HR Management in undergrad…).

The journey really started for me back in middle/high school as I was very interested in video games, computers, and how things worked. So with a few friends started a computer repair "business" that serviced the local (Western Pennsylvania) area. By the time my sophomore year of highschool rolled around we had lined up a few of the parents who owned local businesses/churches and were doing some pretty serious consulting/maintenance for our ages (also installing Halo and Half-life 2: Deathmatch on the school's servers...).]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">469533e2-7193-41b3-a754-adb5281e276f</guid><pubDate>Thu, 31 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Ricky Hosfelt</dc:creator></item><item><title>Listening and trust, part 1</title><link>http://aturon.github.io/2018/05/25/listening-part-1/</link><description><![CDATA[For me, most weeks working on Rust are fun — exhilarating, even. But, just like with anything else, some weeks are hard.

As this week draws to a close, I feel troubled. On the one hand, things are looking strong for the 2018 Edition (which I want to write more about soon). But on the other hand, this week I locked two RFC threads, flagged a bunch of comments for moderation, and generally absorbed a lot of emotion from a lot of different quarters of the community. There’s a sense of simmering distrust.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">8e49045f-dc48-4471-bc83-353183d6c4f8</guid><pubDate>Fri, 25 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Aaron Turon</dc:creator></item><item><title>A shared, mutable ecosystem</title><link>https://kodraus.github.io/rust/2018/05/23/a-shared-mutable-ecosystem.html</link><description><![CDATA[Ownership is a fundamental piece of Rust’s story. It amounts to a tight set of rules about who owns a value in a program, how that value can be aliased and mutated, and when that value is dropped. It prevents shared mutable state, which is the root cause of major bugs in software written without the same guarantees.

In this post I’d like to talk about a different kind ownership in though. I’d like to talk about ownership of libraries in the Rust ecosystem and the problem of sustainable maintainership.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">e1fd2a84-e451-4299-9327-eb39f3a1ca8f</guid><pubDate>Wed, 23 May 2018 21:49:12 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Ashley Mannix</dc:creator></item><item><title>How I got into rust</title><link>https://liv.cat/how-i-got-into-rust</link><description><![CDATA[There’s currently a campaign around the #RustReach program where it’s people post their, uh, Rust “origin stories”, so to say.

Although we didn’t make through RGSoC at that time, I learned a lot about how Open Source works; whether it was about learning intricacies of Git, building patience to figure out a bug among thousands of lines of code, or becoming a programmer with better problem-solving and communication skills.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">7ff4bfa8-5426-47a6-9761-3f9c4f090a61</guid><pubDate>Mon, 14 May 2018 05:54:12 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Kanika Saini</dc:creator></item><item><title>On the origin of rustaceans</title><link>https://quietmisdreavus.net/code/2018/05/11/on-the-origin-of-rustaceans/</link><description><![CDATA[The “Increasing Rust’s Reach” projects are kicking off!

I'll be working with Sarah and nano on WebAssembly and I'm really excited to see what we accomplish over the next few months. Even after our first meeting I just know they're gonna do some great things. Over the coming months I'll be documenting their progress, but to kick things off the Rust Community team is asking people to describe their story and how they contribute to Rust, to show off the variety and breadth of our experiences and talent in a wide variety of areas.

After all, using languages like Ruby, Go, or JavaScript, I could have written numerous full stack applications at this point. Why worry about types and ownership and all that nonsense?

Well in Rust, there are certain safety guarantees… yes, you know, the typical spiel. That may have been enough to interest me in rust, but it was not the reason I decided to stick with it — ultimately what drew me in was the community.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">3f740b1f-622f-4a43-a46c-6a0a13818292</guid><pubDate>Wed,  9 May 2018 14:28:15 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Robert Durst</dc:creator></item><item><title>Rust+GNOME Hackfest in Madrid</title><link>https://blog.guillaume-gomez.fr/articles/2018-04-21+Rust%2BGNOME+Hackfest+in+Madrid</link><description><![CDATA[Last week was the third edition of the Rust+GNOME hackfest.

The OpenShine folks are kindly letting us use their offices, on the seventh floor of a building by the Cuatro Caminos roundabout.

I am very, very thankful that this time everyone seems to be working on developing gnome-class. It's a difficult project for me, and more brainpower is definitely welcome — all the indirection, type conversion, GObject obscurity, and procedural macro shenanigans definitely take a toll on oneself.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">53831192-f7e2-4841-898f-f39f1cd9f1ff</guid><pubDate>Wed, 18 Apr 2018 02:55:12 -0500</pubDate><dc:creator>Federico Mena Quintero</dc:creator></item><item><title>Increasing Rust’s Reach 2018</title><link>https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/04/02/Increasing-Rusts-Reach-2018.html</link><description><![CDATA[The Rust team is happy to announce that we’re running our Increasing Rust’s Reach program again this year.
