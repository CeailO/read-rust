Although we didn’t make through RGSoC at that time, I learned a lot about how Open Source works; whether it was about learning intricacies of Git, building patience to figure out a bug among thousands of lines of code, or becoming a programmer with better problem-solving and communication skills.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">7ff4bfa8-5426-47a6-9761-3f9c4f090a61</guid><pubDate>Mon, 14 May 2018 05:54:12 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Kanika Saini</dc:creator></item><item><title>On the origin of rustaceans</title><link>https://quietmisdreavus.net/code/2018/05/11/on-the-origin-of-rustaceans/</link><description><![CDATA[The “Increasing Rust’s Reach” projects are kicking off! With it, the Community Team is asking for people to describe how they contribute to Rust, to demonstrate the breadth of talent and perspective in the community. So here’s my personal Rust story!]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">61b70d34-71d7-4258-b8f2-f3c2cadce508</guid><pubDate>Fri, 11 May 2018 13:30:00 -0500</pubDate><dc:creator>QuietMisdreavus</dc:creator></item><item><title>Increasing Rust&apos;s Reach Kickoff</title><link>https://mgattozzi.com/rust-reach-kickoff</link><description><![CDATA[I have the great pleasure and privilege this year to be one of the mentors for Increasing Rust's Reach. I'll be working with Sarah and nano on WebAssembly and I'm really excited to see what we accomplish over the next few months. Even after our first meeting I just know they're gonna do some great things. Over the coming months I'll be documenting their progress, but to kick things off the Rust Community team is asking people to describe their story and how they contribute to Rust, to show off the variety and breadth of our experiences and talent in a wide variety of areas. This is my story.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">842d15e6-6102-45a0-905c-6a25995f8dc9</guid><pubDate>Fri, 11 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Michael Gattozzi</dc:creator></item><item><title>An Open Source SDK and Serde Magic: My First Two Months as a Member of the Rust Community</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/an-open-source-sdk-and-serde-magic-my-first-two-months-as-a-member-of-the-rust-community-333444af761e</link><description><![CDATA[So why Rust? After all, using languages like Ruby, Go, or JavaScript, I could have written numerous full stack applications at this point. Why worry about types and ownership and all that nonsense?

Well in Rust, there are certain safety guarantees… yes, you know, the typical spiel. That may have been enough to interest me in rust, but it was not the reason I decided to stick with it — ultimately what drew me in was the community.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">3f740b1f-622f-4a43-a46c-6a0a13818292</guid><pubDate>Wed,  9 May 2018 14:28:15 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Robert Durst</dc:creator></item><item><title>Madrid GNOME+Rust Hackfest, part 2</title><link>https://people.gnome.org/~federico/blog/madrid-gnome-rust-2.html</link><description><![CDATA[Hacking on gnome-class continues apace! Philippe updated our dependencies. Alberto made the syntax for per-instance private structsmore ergonomic, and then made that code nice and compact. Martin improved our conversion from CamelCase to snake_case for code generation. Daniel added initial support for GObject properties. This is not finished...; ]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">3a1ac912-0af7-47cb-b540-1cb3efc46956</guid><pubDate>Fri, 20 Apr 2018 08:59:23 +0200</pubDate><dc:creator>Federico Mena Quintero</dc:creator></item><item><title>Rust+GNOME Hackfest in Madrid</title><link>https://blog.guillaume-gomez.fr/articles/2018-04-21+Rust%2BGNOME+Hackfest+in+Madrid</link><description><![CDATA[Last week was the third edition of the Rust+GNOME hackfest. What about talking a bit about what we achieved? The goals of this edition were: Improve gnome-class, improve gtk-rs continuous integration process, improve gtk-rs crates bindings. I'm happy to say that we were able to achieve all of these goals!]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">86f4fa21-5194-4439-a131-85c3a587a1fd</guid><pubDate>Sat, 21 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Guillaume Gomez</dc:creator></item><item><title>Madrid GNOME+Rust Hackfest, part 1</title><link>https://people.gnome.org/~federico/blog/madrid-gnome-rust-1.html</link><description><![CDATA[I'm in Madrid since Monday, at the third GNOME+Rust hackfest! The OpenShine folks are kindly letting us use their offices, on the seventh floor of a building by the Cuatro Caminos roundabout.

I am very, very thankful that this time everyone seems to be working on developing gnome-class. It's a difficult project for me, and more brainpower is definitely welcome — all the indirection, type conversion, GObject obscurity, and procedural macro shenanigans definitely take a toll on oneself.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">53831192-f7e2-4841-898f-f39f1cd9f1ff</guid><pubDate>Wed, 18 Apr 2018 02:55:12 -0500</pubDate><dc:creator>Federico Mena Quintero</dc:creator></item><item><title>Increasing Rust’s Reach 2018</title><link>https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/04/02/Increasing-Rusts-Reach-2018.html</link><description><![CDATA[The Rust team is happy to announce that we’re running our Increasing Rust’s Reach program again this year.
