This includes time I should spend with company, clients and personal live. It leaves me with two options: shed many of my projects (as mxsash does) or find ways of making this more sustainable. Retreating would also mean that on the surviving projects, others would have to cover the resulting gap, often with less skills or experience.",

My path to Rust certainly is not typical (I studied HR Management in undergrad…).\n\nThe journey really started for me back in middle/high school as I was very interested in video games, computers, and how things worked. So with a few friends started a computer repair \"business\" that serviced the local (Western Pennsylvania) area. By the time my sophomore year of highschool rolled around we had lined up a few of the parents who owned local businesses/churches and were doing some pretty serious consulting/maintenance for our ages (also installing Halo and Half-life 2: Deathmatch on the school's servers...).",

On the one hand, things are looking strong for the 2018 Edition (which I want to write more about soon). But on the other hand, this week I locked two RFC threads, flagged a bunch of comments for moderation, and generally absorbed a lot of emotion from a lot of different quarters of the community.

It prevents shared mutable state, which is the root cause of major bugs in software written without the same guarantees.\n\nIn this post I’d like to talk about a different kind ownership in though. I’d like to talk about ownership of libraries in the Rust ecosystem and the problem of sustainable maintainership.",
