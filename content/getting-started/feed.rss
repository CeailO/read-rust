Functions in Rust do not differ that much from Java methods but there are a few little differences. There is also the topic of Rust’s lifetimes compared to Java’s garbage collection that one could argue separates the two from each other a bit more, but for this post I will focus on the structure of writing a function in Rust. Due to the similarities between the two, I believe most Java developers will have no problem in figuring out what arguments a Rust function takes, what it outputs and where the output is returned from.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">e5f704af-b1ed-4757-b96d-80402ba3e601</guid><pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2018 18:28:19 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Dan Newton</dc:creator></item><item><title>Setting up Windows 10 for programming (in Rust)</title><link>https://exyr.org/2018/windows/</link><description>Lately I’ve been working with Windows-specific APIs, so I needed to get a Windows dev environment. I’ve mostly used Linux for many years now, so for me programming on Windows feels very foreign. Getting to a point where I started being productive took a number of steps, so here they are, if only for me to find them next time.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">4abf1536-2c82-411a-be74-e85d2155af5a</guid><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Simon Sapin</dc:creator></item><item><title>Practical Rust: Installation &amp; Hello World</title><link>https://medium.com/@gallantmrgn/practical-rust-installation-hello-world-d1e52aac1f9</link><description>Recently, a new language called Rust has come into the spotlight, aiming to be a ‘blazingly fast’ language meant for systems programming…</description><guid isPermaLink="false">49ad5651-12e0-4374-9586-d9a86291c165</guid><pubDate>Fri,  2 Feb 2018 18:08:04 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Morgan A.

Maybe, they are truly Rust&apos;s Monads. Let&apos;s talk about what they are, where you encounter them and then how to get competent with them.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">c0b3d7ad-673f-4eb9-aa54-45447d1eafb0</guid><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jan 2018 15:30:00 +0100</pubDate><dc:creator>Florian Gilcher</dc:creator></item><item><title>Beginner Bites: A taste of Rust, a safe, concurrent and practical language!</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/a-taste-of-rust-6d8fc60e050</link><description>Experience a sampler of Rust.
