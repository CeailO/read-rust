It’s been promoted and presented as the ultra safe language, so naturally I decided to check it out. The upcoming series of posts “Journey into rust” will describe and document my experiences using rust, hopefully explaining certain concepts that rust does differently. This will all be written from a C++ programmers standpoint that was thought writing Object Oriented code. I encourage you the reader to think critically and correct where necessary.

On to the actual first post! After reading “the Rust Programming Language” I wanted to get my hands dirty and actually write some code. I like graphical applications and using low level graphics API’s so I decided to implement a cellular automation in rust. But just implementing cellular automation isn’t very exciting, is it? What if we could do this on the GPU…And off I went on my journey to create Conway’s game of life in rust.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">b7c9c3df-7ecd-41f3-8c89-5c1d35298b7b</guid><pubDate>Tue,  7 Aug 2018 22:30:01 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Jonathan Steyfkens</dc:creator></item><item><title>Rust Modules In Less Than 5 Minutes</title><link>https://medium.com/@erik.tate/rust-modules-in-less-than-5-minutes-9bff7f617798</link><description><![CDATA[When I started learning Rust, the module system did not at first seem to be a shining beacon of intuitive design. The Rust documentation is phenomenal, but there are definitely some areas that I found difficult to follow; this being one such topic.

Already familiar way of learning and exercising, patented by Ruby programmers, where you correct tests and make them work. Also whole method of learning was similar to reading 'Little Schemer' fairly popular book among fellow Lispers. So I'll use this blog post to summarize few early impressions about Rust, and let me tell you straight away, I am loving it so far!]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">d6b87789-dd86-49e2-91b6-692607e32f67</guid><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Filip Miletic</dc:creator></item><item><title>Ownership in Rust, Part 2</title><link>https://medium.com/@thomascountz/ownership-in-rust-part-2-c3e1da89956e</link><description><![CDATA[It’s still not problem.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">62456010-4ef4-4f1d-87f0-6e0c64929d82</guid><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jul 2018 16:55:03 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Thomas Countz</dc:creator></item><item><title>Ownership in Rust, Part 1</title><link>https://medium.com/@thomascountz/ownership-in-rust-part-1-112036b1126b</link><description><![CDATA[It’s not my problem.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">c0f25118-a040-4f57-bd18-1594ce4e72f6</guid><pubDate>Mon,  9 Jul 2018 20:58:44 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Thomas Countz</dc:creator></item><item><title>Learning Rust 02: an ls clone</title><link>https://routley.io/tech/2018/07/08/learning-rust-02.html</link><description><![CDATA[In this post, I’m building an ls clone.

It's a valid question. Does your code need to be as fast as possible? Will it be running on the Web? Will the code be on the back end or the front? All languages have their niches, and Rust is no different.

Rust is a statically typed compiled language that fills the roles that most users use C or C++ for. Unlike C or C++, though, Rust also encroaches on territory that C# and the Java™ language have dominated for much of this century: Rust is a language that is memory safe and operating system agnostic, meaning that it can run on any computer. Essentially, you get all the speed and low-level benefits of a systems language without the pesky garbage collection of those latter languages I mentioned. Excited? Yeah, me, too. Welcome to Rust! ]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">3f1b68cd-7c14-415e-bbe9-45db4342a95e</guid><pubDate>Mon,  7 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Dylan Hicks</dc:creator></item><item><title>WASM+Rust Tutorial</title><link>https://freemasen.github.io/wasm_tutorial/</link><description><![CDATA[A project used for a meetup talk about getting started with rust & wasm]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">91fb984c-4084-4b2c-84e5-ebda94169657</guid><pubDate>Thu,  3 May 2018 07:30:00 +1000</pubDate><dc:creator>Robert Masen</dc:creator></item><item><title>An interactive guide to learning Rust!</title><link>https://github.com/toidiu/learn-rust</link><description><![CDATA[Fix a series to broken Rust programs to gain a deeper understanding of Rust.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">d4c2f839-050c-4134-868d-eab325676917</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Apr 2018 06:47:00 +1000</pubDate><dc:creator>toidiu</dc:creator></item><item><title>A Gentle Introduction to Rust (book)</title><link>http://stevedonovan.github.io/rust-gentle-intro/</link><description><![CDATA[Introduction to the Rust language, standard library and ecosystem]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">cf92e0a9-88ac-4fa8-9ecd-d61078868f26</guid><pubDate>Thu,  5 Apr 2018 07:00:00 +1000</pubDate><dc:creator>Steve J Donovan</dc:creator></item><item><title>Getting started with Rust: Enum on steroids!</title><link>https://www.mathieu-nivoliez.com/posts/2018-04-01-getting-started-with-rust-enum-on-steroids.html</link><description><![CDATA[Hello everyone!

They are used to hold data within a logical unit that can be passed to other functions or execute their own methods on the values that they store. Now this sounds very familiar… Java objects do the same thing. For example if you took a POJO (Plain Old Java Object) you also pass it to other methods or execute the object’s own methods. In this nature they are alike, but they do have their differences. In this post we will look into creating structs, retrieving their values, defining their own methods and how to execute them.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">4c17c0f4-8148-4408-a54f-733e20c89189</guid><pubDate>Thu,  1 Mar 2018 20:03:54 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Dan Newton</dc:creator></item><item><title>Rust for Java Devs – Creating functions</title><link>https://lankydanblog.com/2018/02/18/rust-for-java-devs-creating-functions/</link><description><![CDATA[In this post of Rust for Java Devs we will look at creating functions in Rust. Functions in Rust do not differ that much from Java methods but there are a few little differences. There is also the topic of Rust’s lifetimes compared to Java’s garbage collection that one could argue separates the two from each other a bit more, but for this post I will focus on the structure of writing a function in Rust. Due to the similarities between the two, I believe most Java developers will have no problem in figuring out what arguments a Rust function takes, what it outputs and where the output is returned from.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">e5f704af-b1ed-4757-b96d-80402ba3e601</guid><pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2018 18:28:19 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Dan Newton</dc:creator></item><item><title>Beginner Bites: A taste of Rust, a safe, concurrent and practical language!</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/a-taste-of-rust-6d8fc60e050</link><description><![CDATA[Experience a sampler of Rust.
