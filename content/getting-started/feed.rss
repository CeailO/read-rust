After all a programming language (at least the high level and dynamic ones) is just assignment, calculation, branching, looping and reuse (and in certain cases, concurrency/parallelism, not gonna dive deep in defining the difference though). Well, that was true until I started learning Rust, partly for my own leisure. I still don’t feel comfortable writing a complete Rust code.

I saw it coming up frequently in interesting projects (e.g. ripgrep) and kept hearing good things about it. My hesitation to picking up Rust since its 1.0 release in 2015 came from two fronts. First, I’m completely invested in Go because of InfluxDB. Second, I heard that it was not the easiest thing to learn. While I don’t normally shy away from difficult tasks, I was hesitant because I believe that many developer tools that take off do so because they are easy to use or give developers significant productivity gains. More often than not, I want to invest my time in tools that I think have longevity that will get some critical mass in the market.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">fae7cb69-a7bf-4cb1-9d1d-f5e703312ef7</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Oct 2018 18:45:16 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Paul Dix</dc:creator></item><item><title>My Experience With Learning Rust</title><link>https://medium.com/@nathanielbarragan/my-experience-with-learning-rust-bbcb6b7c1063</link><description><![CDATA[Although I didn’t start writing this blog when I started writing in Rust, I remember clearly why I started writing in Rust. From what I had been doing in C#, none of it utilized multiple threads. Multi-threaded programming had always been a sore topic for me. Things like thread synchronization and message passing never really made sense to me. I learned Rust mainly due to its promises for ease of programming for multiple threads. Once hearing that things like parts of Firefox were written using it, and the Mozilla themselves were very strongly invested in Rust, I had more reason to start writing in it. I’d assume that if Mozilla were to invest so much in a programming language, it must have some sort of benefits over your usual C and C++ programming languages. Even further than that, I’ve heard of some game studios adopting Rust in their games and I was pretty much hooked at that point.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">60825132-c54b-4297-9f81-936601b76f64</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Oct 2018 02:29:02 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Nathaniel Barragan</dc:creator></item><item><title>Building a command-line todo app in Rust</title><link>https://medium.com/@devashishdxt/building-a-command-line-todo-app-in-rust-a89bb7af91c3</link><description><![CDATA[In this tutorial, we are going to create a simple command-line todo app. By the end of this tutorial, you should have a basic understanding of Rust programming language, building command-line apps in Rust, and performing file-system operations in Rust.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">ceb7c2a6-d905-4b13-8f42-4aa42cd9b3e3</guid><pubDate>Fri, 12 Oct 2018 13:14:56 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Devashish Dixit</dc:creator></item><item><title>Understanding Compilers — For Humans (Version 2)</title><link>https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-compilers-for-humans-version-2-157f0edb02dd</link><description><![CDATA[Understanding your compiler internally allows you to use it effectively.

For the unfamiliar, pass-by-value means that when passing an argument to a function it gets copied into the new function so that the value in the calling function and the value in the called function are two separate values. Changes to one will not in turn result in the same change to the other. Pass-by-reference, on the other hand, means that when passing an argument to a function, it doesn’t copy the value but rather the argument is merely a transparent reference to the original value. This means changes to the value in the called function change the value in the calling function since they are the same value.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">e112cc10-746d-4151-b0e4-76832be74e09</guid><pubDate>Wed, 12 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Ryan Levick</dc:creator></item><item><title>Rust: My first impressions</title><link>https://erik.doernenburg.com/2018/09/rust-my-first-impressions/</link><description><![CDATA[At work I’m seeing more and more embedded software; over the past few years in, among others, coffee machines, forklifts, and cars. Embedded software needs to be fast and extremely efficient with hardware resources. In some cases it not even acceptable to have a tiny break for some garbage collection. So, typical tech stacks for backend development can’t be used, never mind anything that uses browser technologies. Unsurprisingly, almost all embedded software is written in C++, and, in fact, that is also what I used recently for a personal project with a micro-controller.

Looking through the remaining choices, I went past Golang, which uses garbage collection, and set my eyes on Rust. In this post I’ll describe my first impressions, some of the frustrating moments, but also the extremely impressive performance on a larger piece of code.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">6d814a89-7614-47d1-b3f4-b660279b379d</guid><pubDate>Fri,  7 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><dc:creator>Erik Dörnenburg</dc:creator></item><item><title>Adventures in Rust: Futures and Tokio</title><link>http://bryangilbert.com/post/code/rust/adventures-futures-tokio-rust/</link><description><![CDATA[One of my newer hobbies recently has been learning and toying around with Rust. Recently, as part of this learning process, I've started implementing an IP address lookup service as a small side project. During the course of implementing this project I ran into what turned out to be a bit of a hurdle to tackle, specifically performing reverse dns resolution asynchronously.

My hope is that through exploring this problem, I can aid others in understanding these concepts which can be initially difficult grasp. This is especially so as the behavior and function of Futures vary wildly between various languages and runtimes.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">7b94766b-f2c3-42f6-b215-7b63f07a4e95</guid><pubDate>Tue,  4 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Bryan Gilbert</dc:creator></item><item><title>O(1) sum_of_multiples() in Rust</title><link>https://nicholassterling.wordpress.com/2018/08/31/o1-sum_of_multiples-in-rust/</link><description><![CDATA[I had been working mostly in Scala for a while, then took a diversion into Swift and Objective C.

It’s been promoted and presented as the ultra safe language, so naturally I decided to check it out. The upcoming series of posts “Journey into rust” will describe and document my experiences using rust, hopefully explaining certain concepts that rust does differently. This will all be written from a C++ programmers standpoint that was thought writing Object Oriented code. I encourage you the reader to think critically and correct where necessary.

On to the actual first post! After reading “the Rust Programming Language” I wanted to get my hands dirty and actually write some code. I like graphical applications and using low level graphics API’s so I decided to implement a cellular automation in rust. But just implementing cellular automation isn’t very exciting, is it? What if we could do this on the GPU…And off I went on my journey to create Conway’s game of life in rust.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">b7c9c3df-7ecd-41f3-8c89-5c1d35298b7b</guid><pubDate>Tue,  7 Aug 2018 22:30:01 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Jonathan Steyfkens</dc:creator></item><item><title>Rust Modules In Less Than 5 Minutes</title><link>https://medium.com/@erik.tate/rust-modules-in-less-than-5-minutes-9bff7f617798</link><description><![CDATA[When I started learning Rust, the module system did not at first seem to be a shining beacon of intuitive design.

It's a valid question. Does your code need to be as fast as possible? Will it be running on the Web? Will the code be on the back end or the front? All languages have their niches, and Rust is no different.

Rust is a statically typed compiled language that fills the roles that most users use C or C++ for. Unlike C or C++, though, Rust also encroaches on territory that C# and the Java™ language have dominated for much of this century: Rust is a language that is memory safe and operating system agnostic, meaning that it can run on any computer. Essentially, you get all the speed and low-level benefits of a systems language without the pesky garbage collection of those latter languages I mentioned. Excited? Yeah, me, too.

They are used to hold data within a logical unit that can be passed to other functions or execute their own methods on the values that they store. Now this sounds very familiar… Java objects do the same thing. For example if you took a POJO (Plain Old Java Object) you also pass it to other methods or execute the object’s own methods. In this nature they are alike, but they do have their differences. In this post we will look into creating structs, retrieving their values, defining their own methods and how to execute them.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">4c17c0f4-8148-4408-a54f-733e20c89189</guid><pubDate>Thu,  1 Mar 2018 20:03:54 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Dan Newton</dc:creator></item><item><title>Rust for Java Devs – Creating functions</title><link>https://lankydanblog.com/2018/02/18/rust-for-java-devs-creating-functions/</link><description><![CDATA[In this post of Rust for Java Devs we will look at creating functions in Rust. Functions in Rust do not differ that much from Java methods but there are a few little differences. There is also the topic of Rust’s lifetimes compared to Java’s garbage collection that one could argue separates the two from each other a bit more, but for this post I will focus on the structure of writing a function in Rust. Due to the similarities between the two, I believe most Java developers will have no problem in figuring out what arguments a Rust function takes, what it outputs and where the output is returned from.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">e5f704af-b1ed-4757-b96d-80402ba3e601</guid><pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2018 18:28:19 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Dan Newton</dc:creator></item><item><title>Beginner Bites: A taste of Rust, a safe, concurrent and practical language!</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/a-taste-of-rust-6d8fc60e050</link><description><![CDATA[Experience a sampler of Rust.

I’ve mostly used Linux for many years now, so for me programming on Windows feels very foreign.
