title: Welcome to the New Read Rust
is_draft: true
---

Read Rust proved popular during January so I've decided to broaden its scope
a little and keep the Rust posts flowing in post #Rust2018. There's now
a collection of top level categories. Interesting new posts are added to one
or more categories. Each category has RSS and JSON feeds. There is also
new RSS and JSON feeds that include every new post.

Additionally new posts are also posted to the Read Rust Twitter and Mastodon
accounts so hopefully no matter where you want to read your Rust news there's
a convienient source.
