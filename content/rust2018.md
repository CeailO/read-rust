On Jan 3 2018 the Rust blog put out a [call for community blog
posts][call-for-posts] in January that reflected on 2017 and proposed goals and
directions for Rust in 2018. Responses have flooded in across Twitter, Reddit,
and elsewhere.

Here you will find feeds that you can subscribe to in order to keep up with
new posts, no matter where they are published.

## FAQ

### How do I submit a new post?

Posts published to Twitter under the [#Rust2018] hash tag should be
added automatically. Posts to [/r/rust][rust-reddit] should also get added.
If a post is missing [create an issue in GitHub][add-post].

### What do I do with these feeds?

You subscribe to them in a feed reader. Some options are shown below.
