Beyond that, Rust provides new abstraction capabilities like parametricity, type-traits, methods, a module system, thread-safety, and more.",

This sort of thing is common when buying used CDs, especially if they need to transit a USPS international shipping center. I shelved it and kept on the lookout for another copy, which I located last month. It arrived on Friday, I immediately tried to rip it, and hit the exact same error.

Both were written dirty and fast, and they does not follow the usual Python conventions (but they work as standalone binaries). They do their job, and normally I would say that’s enough. But those utilities are simple and have no big complications under the hood, so they are perfect candidates for rewriting in Rust for the sake of writing in Rust (I’m learning it!).

Originally, I have proposed creating a special Cargo subcommand to execute build tasks, implemented as Rust programs, in this thread. However, since then I realized that there are built-in tools in Cargo which allow one to get a pretty ergonomic solution. Namely, the combination of workspaces, aliases and ability to define binaries seems to do the trick.",
