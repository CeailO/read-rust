The end result works very well (to my pleasant surprise). It doesnâ€™t have 90% of the functionalities of any of rakarrack, guitar rig, garage band but overall it was a fun weekend hack.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">60238a1c-95ee-46d8-bf5c-e70fed87a103</guid><pubDate>Tue,  6 Feb 2018 04:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Ricky Han</dc:creator></item><item><title>DataFusion: Big Data Platform for Rust</title><link>https://www.datafusion.rs/</link><description>DataFusion is an open-source Big Data platform implemented in the Rust programming language with a similar programming style to Apache Spark.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">434c400b-b4ac-49c9-87fa-db2a8b5f1ba7</guid><pubDate>Sun,  4 Feb 2018 16:51:47 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Andy Grove</dc:creator></item><item><title>retrobasic - A BASIC interpreter written in Rust</title><link>https://github.com/seasalim/retrobasic</link><description>retrobasic is a BASIC interpreter written in Rust. It is based on the original BASIC &apos;64 implementation, and modified as needed to make it more compatible with some of the classic BASIC games.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">303b0429-9b0c-46f8-a555-fbab8c2bdf90</guid><pubDate>Sun,  4 Feb 2018 17:21:55 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>seasalim</dc:creator></item><item><title>Writing a command-line program in Rust - Federico&apos;s Blog</title><link>https://people.gnome.org/~federico/blog/writing-a-command-line-program-in-rust.html</link><description>As a library writer, it feels a bit strange, but refreshing, to write a program that actually has a main() function. My experience with Rust so far has been threefold:</description><guid isPermaLink="false">4aeb0aa5-6a72-41c9-87bc-a2e24b5e33d3</guid><pubDate>Sat,  3 Feb 2018 11:41:20 -0600</pubDate><dc:creator>Federico Mena Quintero</dc:creator></item><item><title>Make your own make</title><link>https://matklad.github.io/2018/01/03/make-your-own-make.html</link><description>An obvious idea is to use Rust for task automation. Originally, I have proposed creating a special Cargo subcommand to execute build tasks, implemented as Rust programs, in this thread.
