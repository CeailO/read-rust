Rust's type system encodes a data-structure's ability to be shared between threads in the type system, which in turn allows the compiler to reject programs where threads directly mutate shared state without locks or other protection mechanisms. In this work, we examine how this aspect of Rust's type system impacts the development and refinement of a concurrent data structure, as well as its ability to adapt to situations where correctness is guaranteed by lower-level invariants (e.g., in lock-free algorithms) that are not directly expressible in the type system itself. We detail the implementation of a concurrent lock-free hashmap in order to describe these traits of the Rust language.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">d9831a1a-f79f-4c0b-af9e-b4c5b65cd74f</guid><pubDate>Sat, 27 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Aditya Saligrama, Andrew Shen, Jon Gjengset</dc:creator></item><item><title>Refactoring Varisat 5: Incremental Solving and Proofs</title><link>https://jix.one/refactoring-varisat-5-incremental-solving-and-proofs/</link><description><![CDATA[This is the fifth and final post in my series about refactoring varisat.

My group of three chose to write our compiler in Rust and it was a fun experience. We spent time coming to design decisions that worked out really well and used Rust’s strengths. Our compiler ended up being around 6800 lines of Rust and I personally put in around 60 hours of solid coding and more on code review and design. In this post I’ll go over some of the design decisions we made and some thoughts on what it was like using Rust.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">61255817-6eef-43ce-9eea-24a8aedbd9f2</guid><pubDate>Thu, 18 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Tristan Hume</dc:creator></item><item><title>Idiomatic monads in Rust</title><link>https://varkor.github.io/blog/2019/03/28/idiomatic-monads-in-rust.html</link><description><![CDATA[A pragmatic new design for high-level abstractions In this post, I’m going to describe a new approach to express monads in Rust. It is the most minimal design I have seen proposed and is, in my eyes, the first plausible design for such abstractions — those commonly known as “higher-kinded types”. This approach depends on a very minimal extension to Rust’s type system. In particular, this approach avoids the need for either higher-kinded types (e.g. as in this design) or full abstraction over traits (e.g. “traits for traits”). Most of the design challenges are tackled directly using existing features.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">42678207-257f-4a9c-868a-ab556d18f9d1</guid><pubDate>Thu, 28 Mar 2019 00:00:28 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>varkor</dc:creator></item><item><title>Face Detection with Tensorflow Rust</title><link>https://cetra3.github.io/blog/face-detection-with-tensorflow-rust/</link><description><![CDATA[One of the promises of machine learning is to be able to use it for object recognition in photos.

Conflict Driven Clause Learning</title><link>https://jix.one/refactoring-varisat-3-cdcl/</link><description><![CDATA[This is the third post in my series about refactoring varisat. In this post the new code base turns into a working SAT solver. While you can use the command line tool or the library to solve some small and easy SAT problems now, there is still a lot ahead to gain feature and performance parity with varisat 0.1.

In the last post we saw how unit propagation is implemented. When some variables are known, unit propagation allows us to derive the values of new variables or finds a clause that cannot be satisfied. Unit propagation alone isn’t enough though, as there is no guarantee to make progress. To continue the search for a satisfying solution after propagating all assignments, it is necessary to make a guess. A natural way to handle this would be recursion and backtracking. This would give us a variant of the DPLL algorithm from which conflict driven clause learning evolved.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">da916659-e0c2-4c4c-a793-b4f7273dcd1f</guid><pubDate>Mon, 18 Mar 2019 20:00:53 +0100</pubDate><dc:creator>Jannis Harder</dc:creator></item><item><title>Scientific computing: a Rust adventure [Part 1 - Zero-cost abstractions]</title><link>https://www.lpalmieri.com/posts/2019-03-12-scientific-computing-a-rust-adventure-part-1-zero-cost-abstractions/</link><description><![CDATA[We left, at the end of the previous episode, with an intuitive understanding of Rust’s ownership system: we worked with vectors of integers, Vec<i32>, and we came up with a naive - but surprisingly fast! - scalar product implementation followed by a very simple sort function using the bubble sort algorithm.

This success has ultimately empowered programmers to more easily build reliable and efficient software, and at its heart lies a novel approach to ownership that balances type system expressivity with usability.

In this work, we set out to capture the essence of this model of ownership by developing a type systems account of Rust's borrow checker. To that end, we present Oxide, a formalized programming language close to source-level Rust (but with fully-annotated types). This presentation takes a new view of lifetimes as approximate provenances of references, and our type system is able to automatically compute this information through a flow-sensitive substructural typing judgment for which we prove syntactic type safety using progress and preservation. The result is a simpler formulation of borrow checking - including recent features such as non-lexical lifetimes - that we hope researchers will be able to use as the basis for work on Rust.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">eac014e1-98a8-4913-9050-5e7a073b8611</guid><pubDate>Sun,  3 Mar 2019 20:22:37 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Aaron Weiss, Daniel Patterson, Nicholas D.

The algorithm maintains, for each pixel of the output image, a probability distribution of the tiles which may be placed there. It repeatedly chooses a pixel to “collapse” - choosing a tile to use for that pixel based on its distribution. WFC gets its name from quantum physics.

Going beyond memory safety, for instance, to guarantee the absence of assertion failures or functional correctness, requires static program verification. Formal verification of system software is notoriously difficult and requires complex specifications and logics to reason about pointers, aliasing, and side effects on mutable state. This complexity is a major obstacle to a more widespread verification of system software.

In this paper, we present a novel verification technique that leverages Rust’s type system to greatly simplify the specification and verification of Rust programs. We analyse information from the Rust compiler and synthesise a corresponding core proof for the program in a flavour of separation logic tailored to automation. Crucially, our proofs are constructed and checked automatically; users of our work never work with the underlying formal logic. Users can add specifications at the abstraction level of Rust expressions; we show how to interweave these to extend our core proof to prove modularly whether these specifications are correct. We have implemented our technique for a subset of Rust; our initial evaluation on two thousand functions from widely-used Rust crates demonstrates its effectiveness]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">d282adbf-dce7-4fbb-86e5-2d33df229932</guid><pubDate>Mon, 17 Dec 2018 07:00:47 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Astrauskas, Vytautas; Müller, Peter; Poli, Federico; Summers, Alexander</dc:creator></item><item><title>The Swiss Army Knife of Hashmaps</title><link>https://blog.waffles.space/2018/12/07/deep-dive-into-hashbrown/</link><description><![CDATA[A while back, there was a discussion comparing the performance of using the hashbrown crate (based on Google’s SwissTable implementation) in the Rust compiler. In the last RustFest, Amanieu was experimenting on integrating his crate into stdlib, which turned out to have some really promising results. As a result, it’s being planned to move the crate into stdlib.

While the integration is still ongoing, there’s currently no blog post out there explaining SwissTable at the moment. So, I thought I’d dig deeper into the Rust implementation to try and explain how its (almost) identical twin hashbrown::HashMap works.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">4ea6d02a-6279-4eef-af2f-bd67424d6de8</guid><pubDate>Fri,  7 Dec 2018 16:58:46 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Ravi Shankar</dc:creator></item><item><title>Shifgrethor IV: Tracing</title><link>https://boats.gitlab.io/blog/post/shifgrethor-iv/</link><description><![CDATA[The post before this one covered how shifgrethor handles rooting: how we track for the garbage collector that this object is alive.

By avoiding state explosion and supporting live changes to the data-flow graph, this model makes data-flow viable for building long-lived, low-latency applications, such as web applications. Our implementation, Noria, simplifies the backend infrastructure for read-heavy web applications while improving their performance.

A Noria application supplies a relational schema and a set of parameterized queries, which Noria compiles into a data-flow program that pre-computes results for reads and incrementally applies writes. Noria makes it easy to write high-performance applications without manual performance tuning or complex-to-maintain caching layers. Partial statefulness helps Noria limit its in-memory state without prior data-flow systems’ restriction to windowed state, and helps Noria adapt its data-flow to schema and query changes while on-line. Unlike prior data-flow systems, Noria also shares state and computation across related queries, eliminating duplicate work.

On a real web application’s queries, our prototype scales to 5× higher load than a hand-optimized MySQL baseline. Noria also outperforms a typical MySQL/memcached stack and the materialized views of a commercial database. It scales to tens of millions of reads and millions of writes per second over multiple servers, outperforming a state-of-the-art streaming data-flow system.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">b2cb0409-6147-4d84-8261-734f17fda39c</guid><pubDate>Tue,  9 Oct 2018 11:14:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Jon Gjengset, Malte Schwarzkopf, Jonathan Behrens, and Lara Timbó Araújo</dc:creator></item><item><title>Travel The World Using Partially-Mapped (PMX) Crossover in Rust And JavaScript</title><link>https://blog.x5ff.xyz/blog/ai-rust-javascript-pmx/</link><description><![CDATA[Implementing a genetic algorithm in JavaScript and Rust.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">f7523f30-31c4-4699-9071-ec6f7ccd1049</guid><pubDate>Sun, 26 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Claus</dc:creator></item><item><title>So You Want to Build a Language VM in Rust - Part 00</title><link>https://medium.com/iridium-vm/so-you-want-to-build-a-language-vm-part-0-f9132f611a1b</link><description><![CDATA[Hi there!

Aim: We wanted to find out what kind of cryptographic libraries are present in Rust and how usable they are. Method: We explored Rust's cryptographic libraries through a systematic search, conducted an exploratory study on the major libraries and a controlled experiment on two of these libraries with 28 student participants. Results: Only half of the major libraries explicitly focus on usability and misuse resistance, which is reflected in their current APIs. We found that participants were more successful using rust-crypto which we considered less usable than ring before the experiment. Conclusion: We discuss API design insights and make recommendations for the design of crypto libraries in Rust regarding the detail and structure of the documentation, higher-level APIs as wrappers for the existing low-level libraries, and selected, good-quality example code to improve the emerging cryptographic libraries of Rust.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">ab3d6484-4107-4555-a9b0-0f1aa6ae9a18</guid><pubDate>Tue, 26 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Kai Mindermann, Philipp Keck, Stefan Wagner</dc:creator></item><item><title>Generic associated types in iterators</title><link>https://boiethios.gitlab.io/blog/2018-06-21_GATs_iterators.html</link><description><![CDATA[In this article, I want to explain the term Generic Associated Types through a concrete example.

Unfortunately, many known schemes that enable search queries on encrypted data achieve efficiency at the expense of security, as they reveal access patterns to the encrypted data.  In this paper we present Oblix, a search index for encrypted data that is oblivious (provably hides access patterns), is dynamic (supports inserts and deletes), and has good efficiency.  Oblix relies on a combination of novel oblivious-access tech- niques and recent hardware enclave platforms (e.g., Intel SGX).  In particular, a key technical contribution is the design and implementation of doubly-oblivious data structures, in which the client’s accesses to its internal memory are oblivious, in addition to accesses to its external memory at the server. These algorithms are motivated by hardware enclaves like SGX, which leak access patterns to both internal and external memory.  We demonstrate the usefulness of Oblix in several applications: private contact discovery for Signal, private retrieval of public keys for Key Transparency, and searchable encryption that hides access patterns and result sizes.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">e2724828-a6e9-4383-9614-bea31e743784</guid><pubDate>Mon, 21 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Pratyush Mishra, Rishabh Poddar, Jerry Chen, Alessandro Chiesa, Raluca Ada Popa</dc:creator></item><item><title>Cannoli: A Python Compiler Written in Rust [pdf]</title><link>https://github.com/joncatanio/cannoli/raw/master/resources/papers/cannoli-thesis-paper.pdf</link><description><![CDATA[I just finished my Master's Thesis and part of it was writing a Python compiler in Rust.

While there can be multiple borrows of the same object, each object has a unique owner. When objects are passed by value, ownership is transferred to the new scope, and the old scope can no longer access it. This makes it possible to implement “consuming” methods which take self by value, and therefore can only be called once. In the party and dealer types, such methods consume the previous state and return the next state in the protocol.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">0308ada3-604c-4240-8e94-2f9d23bc2934</guid><pubDate>Fri, 11 May 2018 22:25:19 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Cathie Yun</dc:creator></item><item><title>KRust: A Formal Executable Semantics of Rust</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.10806</link><description><![CDATA[Rust is a new and promising high-level system programming language. It provides both memory safety and thread safety through its novel mechanisms such as ownership, moves and borrows. Ownership system ensures that at any point there is only one owner of any given resource. The ownership of a resource can be moved or borrowed according to the lifetimes. The ownership system establishes a clear lifetime for each value and hence does not necessarily need garbage collection. These novel features bring Rust high performance, fine low-level control of C and C++, and unnecessity in garbage collection, which differ Rust from other existing prevalent languages. For formal analysis of Rust programs and helping programmers learn its new mechanisms and features, a formal semantics of Rust is desired and useful as a fundament for developing related tools. In this paper, we present a formal executable operational semantics of a realistic subset of Rust, called KRust. The semantics is defined in K, a rewriting-based executable semantic framework for programming languages. The executable semantics yields automatically a formal interpreter and verification tools for Rust programs. KRust has been thoroughly validated by testing with hundreds of tests, including the official Rust test suite.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">0c0d7114-9e80-4e4f-868d-51de6778bed1</guid><pubDate>Sat, 28 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Feng Wang, Fu Song, Min Zhang, Xiaoran Zhu, Jun Zhang</dc:creator></item><item><title>QCGPU - Hardware Accelerated Quantum Computer Simulation</title><link>https://qcgpu.github.io/</link><description><![CDATA[A software library for high performance and hardware accelerated simulation of Quantum Computers and Algorithms.

I explained how they enable giving a safe API to code that could previously only be exposed with unsafe, and how one could go about proving such a thing. This post is about another application of pinned references—another API whose safety relies on the pinning guarantees: Intrusive collections. It turns out that pinned references can almost be used for this, but not quite. However, this can be fixed by extending the guarantees provided by pinned references, as suggested by @cramertj.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">68ff8b22-500f-4674-b9f0-b70414db12d8</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Ralf Jung</dc:creator></item><item><title>Writing a recursive ascent parser by hand</title><link>https://www.abubalay.com/blog/2018/04/08/recursive-ascent</link><description><![CDATA[I’ve been exploring various ways to write parsers.
