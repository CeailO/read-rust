Garbage collection is the traditional memory management scheme for functional languages, whereas type systems are now used for memory safety in imperative languages. We use existing techniques for linear capabilities to provide safe access to copyable references, but the application to languages with a tracing garbage collector, and to data with explicit lifetimes is new. This work is related to mixed linear/non-linear programming, but the languages being mixed are Rust and JavaScript.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">04445b84-5c91-467e-840c-45df1765c4e6</guid><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Alan Jeffrey</dc:creator></item><item><title>How Usable are Rust Cryptography APIs?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.04929</link><description><![CDATA[Poor usability of cryptographic APIs is a severe source of vulnerabilities. Aim: We wanted to find out what kind of cryptographic libraries are present in Rust and how usable they are. Method: We explored Rust's cryptographic libraries through a systematic search, conducted an exploratory study on the major libraries and a controlled experiment on two of these libraries with 28 student participants. Results: Only half of the major libraries explicitly focus on usability and misuse resistance, which is reflected in their current APIs. We found that participants were more successful using rust-crypto which we considered less usable than ring before the experiment. Conclusion: We discuss API design insights and make recommendations for the design of crypto libraries in Rust regarding the detail and structure of the documentation, higher-level APIs as wrappers for the existing low-level libraries, and selected, good-quality example code to improve the emerging cryptographic libraries of Rust.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">ab3d6484-4107-4555-a9b0-0f1aa6ae9a18</guid><pubDate>Tue, 26 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Kai Mindermann, Philipp Keck, Stefan Wagner</dc:creator></item><item><title>Generic associated types in iterators</title><link>https://boiethios.gitlab.io/blog/2018-06-21_GATs_iterators.html</link><description><![CDATA[In this article, I want to explain the term Generic Associated Types through a concrete example. I noticed that people (especially in video games development) need some tools to iterate in various manners mutably, efficiently and safely. I tried to write some convenient iterators over vectors and slices that solve those problems, but finally, I understood that some tools cannot be written with std::iter::Iterator. Doing so led me to the comprehension of generic associated types that I will abbreviate as GATs in this article. I will explain here what GATs are and why they are needed.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">6c71975e-3550-410a-99e7-2ee9635fb0e6</guid><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Boiethios</dc:creator></item><item><title>Rust Distilled: An Expressive Tower of Languages</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02693</link><description><![CDATA[Rust represents a major advancement in production programming languages because of its success in bridging the gap between high-level application programming and low-level systems programming.

Unfortunately, many known schemes that enable search queries on encrypted data achieve efficiency at the expense of security, as they reveal access patterns to the encrypted data.  In this paper we present Oblix, a search index for encrypted data that is oblivious (provably hides access patterns), is dynamic (supports inserts and deletes), and has good efficiency.  Oblix relies on a combination of novel oblivious-access tech- niques and recent hardware enclave platforms (e.g., Intel SGX).  In particular, a key technical contribution is the design and implementation of doubly-oblivious data structures, in which the client’s accesses to its internal memory are oblivious, in addition to accesses to its external memory at the server. These algorithms are motivated by hardware enclaves like SGX, which leak access patterns to both internal and external memory.  We demonstrate the usefulness of Oblix in several applications: private contact discovery for Signal, private retrieval of public keys for Key Transparency, and searchable encryption that hides access patterns and result sizes.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">e2724828-a6e9-4383-9614-bea31e743784</guid><pubDate>Mon, 21 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Pratyush Mishra, Rishabh Poddar, Jerry Chen, Alessandro Chiesa, Raluca Ada Popa</dc:creator></item><item><title>Cannoli: A Python Compiler Written in Rust [pdf]</title><link>https://github.com/joncatanio/cannoli/raw/master/resources/papers/cannoli-thesis-paper.pdf</link><description><![CDATA[I just finished my Master's Thesis and part of it was writing a Python compiler in Rust. The goal of the thesis was to evaluate language features of Python that were hypothesized to cause performance issues. Quantifying the cost of these features could be valuable to language designers moving forward. Some interesting results were observed when implementing compiler optimizations for Python. An average speedup of 51% was achieved across a number of benchmarks.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">c7a4923a-2a12-4f88-82fc-4b99b94080e9</guid><pubDate>Thu, 17 May 2018 16:00:59 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Jonathan Catanio</dc:creator></item><item><title>Bulletproof Multi-Party Computation in Rust with Session Types</title><link>https://blog.chain.com/bulletproof-multi-party-computation-in-rust-with-session-types-b3da6e928d5d</link><description><![CDATA[In Rust, objects are either owned or borrowed. While there can be multiple borrows of the same object, each object has a unique owner. When objects are passed by value, ownership is transferred to the new scope, and the old scope can no longer access it. This makes it possible to implement “consuming” methods which take self by value, and therefore can only be called once. In the party and dealer types, such methods consume the previous state and return the next state in the protocol.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">0308ada3-604c-4240-8e94-2f9d23bc2934</guid><pubDate>Fri, 11 May 2018 22:25:19 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Cathie Yun</dc:creator></item><item><title>KRust: A Formal Executable Semantics of Rust</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.10806</link><description><![CDATA[Rust is a new and promising high-level system programming language. It provides both memory safety and thread safety through its novel mechanisms such as ownership, moves and borrows. Ownership system ensures that at any point there is only one owner of any given resource. The ownership of a resource can be moved or borrowed according to the lifetimes. The ownership system establishes a clear lifetime for each value and hence does not necessarily need garbage collection. These novel features bring Rust high performance, fine low-level control of C and C++, and unnecessity in garbage collection, which differ Rust from other existing prevalent languages. For formal analysis of Rust programs and helping programmers learn its new mechanisms and features, a formal semantics of Rust is desired and useful as a fundament for developing related tools. In this paper, we present a formal executable operational semantics of a realistic subset of Rust, called KRust. The semantics is defined in K, a rewriting-based executable semantic framework for programming languages. The executable semantics yields automatically a formal interpreter and verification tools for Rust programs. KRust has been thoroughly validated by testing with hundreds of tests, including the official Rust test suite.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">0c0d7114-9e80-4e4f-868d-51de6778bed1</guid><pubDate>Sat, 28 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Feng Wang, Fu Song, Min Zhang, Xiaoran Zhu, Jun Zhang</dc:creator></item><item><title>QCGPU - Hardware Accelerated Quantum Computer Simulation</title><link>https://qcgpu.github.io/</link><description><![CDATA[A software library for high performance and hardware accelerated simulation of Quantum Computers and Algorithms.

I explained how they enable giving a safe API to code that could previously only be exposed with unsafe, and how one could go about proving such a thing. This post is about another application of pinned references—another API whose safety relies on the pinning guarantees: Intrusive collections. It turns out that pinned references can almost be used for this, but not quite. However, this can be fixed by extending the guarantees provided by pinned references, as suggested by @cramertj.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">68ff8b22-500f-4674-b9f0-b70414db12d8</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Ralf Jung</dc:creator></item><item><title>Writing a recursive ascent parser by hand</title><link>https://www.abubalay.com/blog/2018/04/08/recursive-ascent</link><description><![CDATA[I’ve been exploring various ways to write parsers. For a long time, I’ve used hand-written recursive descent for its straightforwardness, flexibility, and performance.

I decided I would try an experiment: write an LR parser by hand, and see how readable I could make it.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">66851aee-1bf3-4b18-b1aa-50f79ce773f4</guid><pubDate>Sun,  8 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Russell Johnston</dc:creator></item><item><title>im - Immutable Data Structures for Rust</title><link>https://docs.rs/im/10.0.0/im/</link><description><![CDATA[This library implements several of the more commonly useful immutable data structures for Rust.
