      <strong>Current Rust projects</strong>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/djc/askama">Askama</a> is a type-safe compiled Jinja-like templating language for Rust, one of the <a href="https://crates.io/categories/template-engine">most popular</a> Rust templating solutions. It aims to be user-friendly and very efficient.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/djc/quinn">Quinn</a> is a futures-based Rust implementation of the nascent <a href="https://quicwg.github.io/">QUIC</a> internet protocol. It was the subject of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHgyY5DNdvI">May 2018 RustFest presentation</a>. It is not yet usable, but I believe the basis that's there is promising, and I'd like to continue development.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/djc/tokio-imap">tokio-imap and imap-proto</a> are a tokio-based IMAP client and base IMAP protocol library in Rust. imap-proto is also used by <a href="https://github.com/mattnenterprise/rust-imap">rust-imap</a>, the most-popular IMAP library on <a href="http://crates.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">crates.io</a>.</li>

        is a change to how Cargo reads manifests to improve separation between 
        features and dependencies. While I have implemented the Cargo parts of 
        this change, this features will also need changes in the package

      Projects<br>- <strong><a href="http://vulkano.rs/">Vulkano</a></strong> (<em>~45k lines of code</em>) is a safe wrapper around the Vulkan API. It is a low-level brick that allows you to interact with your GPU and execute graphical or compute (GPGPU) operations. Vulkano aims to be very explicit and predictable especially if you are familiar with the Vulkan API, but at the same time provide some high-level functionnalities. Ideal for building a game, a game engine, or a GPGPU application when performances and explicitness matter.<br><br>- <a href="https://github.com/glium/glium"><strong>Glium</strong></a> (<em>~33k lines of code, unmaintained</em>) is a safe wrapper around OpenGL and OpenGL ES. It aims to provide an easy-to-use high-level API while still remaining predictable and not hiding what it does. Even though many people have liked glium, its main goal of being safe was determined to be too difficult because of the many problems with OpenGL itself.<br><br>- <strong><a href="https://github.com/tomaka/android-rs-glue">Android-rs-glue</a></strong> allows you to easily turn your Rust code into an Android package. After installing the Android SDK and NDK, run the <em>`cargo apk</em>` command and you will get an .apk file which you can then install on your device. Works out of the box with <strong>vulkano</strong>, <strong>glium</strong>, <strong>winit</strong> and <strong>glutin</strong>. Also provides a docker image.<br><br>- <strong><a href="https://github.com/tomaka/winit">Winit</a></strong> (<em>~10k lines of code</em>) is a cross-platform window creation library. It allows you to create a basic window on Windows, Linux, MacOS and Android, then lets you handle the events received by this window. In order to show something on the window, you are supposed to create an OpenGL, Vulkan, or DirectX context on top of it, but this is not covered by winit itself.<br><br>- <strong><a href="https://github.com/tomaka/glutin">Glutin</a></strong> (<em>~7k lines of code</em>) does the same as <strong>winit</strong>, but creates an OpenGL context in a cross-platform way on top of the window. The <a href="https://servo.org/">servo</a> project from Mozilla uses a fork of glutin for its own windowing.<br><br>- <a href="https://github.com/tomaka/rodio"><strong>Rodio</strong></a><strong></strong> is a cross-platform high-level audio playback library. It handles decoding audio files, adding filters, pausing/playing, adjusting the volume, and so on.<br><br>- <strong><a href="https://github.com/tomaka/cpal">Cpal</a></strong> is a cross-platform low-level audio playback library used by <strong>rodio</strong>. It opens a channel of communication with the system (WASAPI, ALSA, coreaudio) and allows you to stream PCM data to it.<br><br>- <strong><a href="https://github.com/tomaka/hlua">Hlua</a></strong> is a safe wrapper around the Lua runtime library. Hlua provides a high-level easy-to-use API and handles the Lua stack for you. The library is heavily templated and should have a negligible runtime overhead.<br><br>- <strong><a href="https://github.com/tomaka/rouille">Rouille</a></strong> is a web framework backed by <strong>tiny-http</strong>. Contrary to other Rust web frameworks, rouille lets you write borrow-checker-friendly Rust-code. For example additional parameters to pass to a route handler do not go through the framework but are simply passed as regular function parameters. Rouille is not as shiny-looking as other frameworks, but it should work just as well and is likely more intuitive to use.<br><br>- <strong><a href="https://github.com/tomaka/immi">Immi</a></strong> is a utility toolkit if you want to create an immediate mode user interface. It doesn't perform any drawing, but provides some kind of framework to make your life easier.

      I've been doing open source software for well over 20 years. These days, I'm especially actively involved in the Rust community, contributing to core infrastructure and creative tools. Perhaps my best known project is&nbsp;<a href="https://xi-editor.github.io/xi-editor/" target="_blank">xi-editor</a>, which is still in early stages but has the potential to become a rich and responsive tool for programmers. I also maintain&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/raphlinus/pulldown-cmark" target="_blank">pulldown-cmark</a> and a number of other Rust libraries, and am working on a new GUI toolkit called&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/xi-editor/druid" target="_blank">druid</a>.<br>
      <br>
      I was at Google for 11 years, and did open source both as my main job and in 20% projects. These days, I'm going out on my own, creating a video game with music synthesis as a core mechanic. I'm planning to sell the game commercially, but do the synthesizer and Rust infrastructure work as free software with a permissive license. Supporting me on Patreon is a way to vote for me spending more time on free software work to benefit the community, especially the pieces that I don't otherwise have plans to monetize.<br>

      Projects

      <ul>
      <li><a href="http://nalgebra.org">nalgebra</a> − A linear-algebra library written in rust. This supports matrices of arbitrary dimensions which may or may not be known at compile-time. It features tools for computer graphics including a broad range of transformations (with dedicated types for optimal safety and performances). It is also destined to general linear algebra operation by providing efficient implementation of common matrix Factorizations: SVD, QR, LU, Cholesky, etc.</li>
      <li><a href="http://nalgebra.org/decompositions_and_lapack/#lapack-integration">nalgebra-lapack</a> − Extention to nalgebra to benefit from existing C/Fortran Lapack operations, e.g., for matrix factorization.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/sebcrozet/nphysics">nphysics</a> − A pure-rust physics engine that handles both 2D and 3D (exposed to the user as two crates: nphysics2d and nphysics3d). My first goal is to make it at least as fast and featureful as the bullet and Box2D C++ physics engines.</li>
      <li><a href="http://ncollide.org">ncollide</a> − The collision-detection library underlying nphysics. It is useful on its own when you want to write your physics rules yourself but still need all the geometric operations (distance, interference, contact points, etc.) to be performed efficiently for a wide variety of shapes (including convex hulls).</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/sebcrozet/alga">alga</a>  − An abstract mathematics library. It defines a rich hierarchy of traits from the most simple algebraic entity (the magma) to most complex ones like euclidean spaces, the rotation groups, etc. While sometimes hard to grasp because of the abstract mathematical concepts, it allows extremely flexible generic programming.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/sebcrozet/kiss3d">kiss3d</a>  − A Keep It Simple, Stupid graphics engine. It allows an easy creation of a 3D scene with simple shapes (cubes, cylinders, etc.) and meshes. I don't intend to implement new features, but Pull Requests are very welcome and it will remain updated short after new versions of nalgebra and ncollide are released. </li>

      Building Lemmy - A link aggregator for the fediverse. Lemmy is similar to sites like Reddit, lobste.rs, Raddle, or Hacker News: you subscribe to forums you're interested in, post links and discussions, then vote, and comment on them. Behind the scenes, it is very different; anyone can easily run a server, and all these servers are federated (think email).

      <br>
      → 
      <a href="https://github.com/koute/cargo-web">cargo-web</a> is the tooling counterpart of the stdweb; it supports all of Rust's three Web backends, and can run your tests in a headless Web browser.
