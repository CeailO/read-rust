No matter how many tests you write, or how well-disciplined your team, any new development is sure to introduce a stream of bugs that will need to be shored up over the course of months or years.\n\nCentral to the problem are the edges. People will reliably do a good job of building and testing the happy paths, but as humans we’re terrible at considering the edge conditions, and it’s those edges and corners that cause trouble over the years that a program is in service.",

Furthermore, there isn’t just one RAM, but each memory location can live in different caches at each time and some of them are private to each CPU. It would not make do to publish all the local changes to one’s cache right away.",

Actually, it could be easily argued that my backend-brethren don't really either or, for that matter, anyone who's typically dealing with a garbage collected language. I'm looking over at you JS, Java, and Ruby devs. I'd bet most neckbea.. *cough, excuse me, C developers are comfortable with these issues but alas, I am not. As such, lifetimes were kinda difficult to wrap my head around but I think I get them a little better now so let me try to explain.",

I’ve been a reasonably active member of the C++ community for quite a while now, attending and contributing talks to conferences, following the development and evangelism of the language’s more modern features and of course writing lots of it. C++ is a language that gives its users very fine-grained control over all aspects of the program they are writing, at the cost of a steep learning curve and a large body of knowledge required to write effective C++. However, C++ is also a very old language, conceived by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1985, and thus caries a lot of technical debt even into modern standards.",

Recently I've started a new version of the lm4f120 crate called tm4c123x-hal. The name change reflects TI's new name for basically the exact same part, while the -hal indicates that it's based upon the output of svd2rust and @japaric's new Embedded Hal crate. At the same time, I was watching videos on Youtube about a new wave of 1980's style 'retro' computing boards - text output, BASIC interpreter, etc. An idea started to form that I could put all three of these things together.",

For example in a web page’s content tree, from any DOM node, one can easily access (if any) its first and last child, previous and next sibling, (so children of a node form a doubly-linked list) and parent.

One example of this is the borrow checker which prevents data races, iterator invalidation, pointer invalidation and other issues at compile time. Other memory problems like buffer overflows can’t be prevented at compile time. In those cases the compiler inserts runtime checks, bounds checks in this case, to enforce memory safety at runtime. What about stack overflows? For quite a long time Rust didn’t have stack overflow checking but that wasn’t much of a problem on tier 1 platforms since these platforms have an OS and a MMU (Memory Management Unit) that prevents stack overflows from wreaking havoc.",

As I said back then: I held myself to the same constraints as the original contest; no external packages is a bit painful in Rust, but it’s not too bad. Mostly it would let me eliminate boilerplate while also improving correctness, and making the code a bit shorter. So, that got me thinking: What would this look like if I could use external packages? I took about an hour, and knocked it out. I have two versions to show you today, one where I pay no attention to allocations, and one where it’s zero-allocation.",

It’s difficult to understate just how much time and energy people volunteer in pursuit of a better, Rust-ier world.",
