I just updated the starter code to use the latest versions of everything so it&apos;s now easier to jump from the book to use the latest developments in the Cortex-M ecosystem; there&apos;s no new content, though -- the exercises remain unchanged in terms of goals; just the code has changed.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">0cb6b35f-0d4f-4e71-bcae-66d4cd115d41</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Feb 2018 15:12:44 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Jorge Aparicio</dc:creator></item><item><title>Transcript: Should you Rust in embedded yet?</title><link>https://kazlauskas.me/entries/rust-embedded-ready.html</link><description>This is a transcript of a talk I gave at the Vilnius Rust meetup.

It would not be an exaggeration to say that embedded is omnipresent. You can find embedded firmware everywhere from fridges, microwaves and personal computers to safety-critical applications in automotive, medical fields, etc.

Most of this software is still written in C or C++, and neither of these, given their non-ideal track record in relation to security critical software, are the most confidence inspiring choice for safety-critical systems.

In my experience, bugs occurring in embedded firmware tend to be fairly similar to those commonly found in the user-space software.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">504ed65c-1efe-4cbd-b655-b17e89110936</guid><pubDate>Sat, 24 Feb 2018 20:09:27 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Simonas Kazlauskas</dc:creator></item><item><title>An introduction to writing platform agnostic drivers in Rust using the MCP3008</title><link>http://pramode.in/2018/02/24/an-introduction-to-writing-embedded-hal-based-drivers-in-rust/</link><description>Here is how a device like an accelerometer works: you send the device commands over a serial interface (SPI, I2C), say something like: “get me the X-axis reading”; the device responds by sending back some data.

The way the SPI/I2C/GPIO (and other) interfaces are programmed is very much dependent on the specific microcontroller family. But the actions you need to perform to interface with a device like a temperature sensor / accelerometer etc depend only on the device and are independent of the controller being used. What if you can write a generic accelerometer driver and use it on any microcontroller platform - right from low-end ARM Cortex-M, AVR, MSP430 etc to complex Embedded Linux platforms like the Raspberry Pi? What if you can distribute these drivers on crates.io so that you only have to include one line in your Cargo.toml to use it in your code?</description><guid isPermaLink="false">34ee0b77-cabd-47a8-bb6c-00e8a34046c7</guid><pubDate>Sat, 24 Feb 2018 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><dc:creator>Pramode C.E</dc:creator></item><item><title>I decided to make an 1980&apos;s Home Computer in Rust - Part 1</title><link>http://railwayelectronics.blogspot.com.au/2018/02/i-decided-to-make-1980s-home-computer.html?m=1</link><description>My first attempt at Rust programming was the stellaris-launchpad crate. This has a few demos that either blink the LED or roll it through an RGB rainbow using the PWM timers. Recently I&apos;ve started a new version of the lm4f120 crate called tm4c123x-hal. The name change reflects TI&apos;s new name for basically the exact same part, while the -hal indicates that it&apos;s based upon the output of svd2rust and @japaric&apos;s new Embedded Hal crate. At the same time, I was watching videos on Youtube about a new wave of 1980&apos;s style &apos;retro&apos; computing boards - text output, BASIC interpreter, etc. An idea started to form that I could put all three of these things together.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">b2eb24c3-d7ee-438c-b041-0446dd551abe</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2018 22:16:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>theJPster</dc:creator></item><item><title>Programming an ARM microcontroller in Rust at four different levels of abstraction</title><link>http://pramode.in/2018/02/20/programming-a-microcontroller-in-rust-at-four-levels-of-abstraction/</link><description>Covering: Why Rust on Microcontrollers, Level 1: Direct register access in an unsafe block, Level 2: No unsafe blocks, use the API provided by svd2rust, A problem, Level 3: The embedded HAL to the rescue, Level 4: Use a board support crate.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">f2bf66c3-52bf-4a3c-b508-96bbd3385e8d</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2018 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><dc:creator>Pramode C.E</dc:creator></item><item><title>Weekly driver 1 &amp; 2: L3GD20, LSM303DLHC and Madgwick - Embedded in Rust</title><link>http://blog.japaric.io/wd-1-2-l3gd20-lsm303dlhc-madgwick/</link><description>Oh, time flies. It’s already week 8 and we have zero weekly driver posts out there – don’t worry though because there’s plenty of drivers and embedded-hal implementations in the works. To play catch up in this post I’ll cover two embedded-hal drivers: the l3gd20 and the lsm303dlhc. The L3GD20 is an IC that contains a gyroscope and exposes I2C and SPI interfaces; the LSM303DLHC is an IC that contains an accelerometer and a magnetometer, and exposes an I2C interface. You can find these two ICs on the STM32F3DISCOVERY board.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">25d98aac-94a1-4cda-bbdb-7b22b76ed032</guid><pubDate>Mon, 19 Feb 2018 15:57:59 +0100</pubDate><dc:creator>Jorge Aparicio</dc:creator></item><item><title>Zero cost stack overflow protection for ARM Cortex-M devices</title><link>http://blog.japaric.io/stack-overflow-protection/</link><description>One of the core features of Rust is memory safety. Whenever possible the compiler enforces memory safety at compile. One example of this is the borrow checker which prevents data races, iterator invalidation, pointer invalidation and other issues at compile time. Other memory problems like buffer overflows can’t be prevented at compile time. In those cases the compiler inserts runtime checks, bounds checks in this case, to enforce memory safety at runtime. What about stack overflows? For quite a long time Rust didn’t have stack overflow checking but that wasn’t much of a problem on tier 1 platforms since these platforms have an OS and a MMU (Memory Management Unit) that prevents stack overflows from wreaking havoc.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">45c32609-24ef-4288-b361-57ca8b5a34cd</guid><pubDate>Sat, 17 Feb 2018 18:16:39 +0100</pubDate><dc:creator>Jorge Aparicio</dc:creator></item><item><title>Memory safe DMA transfers - Embedded in Rust</title><link>http://blog.japaric.io/safe-dma/</link><description>A blog about Rust and embedded stuff</description><guid isPermaLink="false">b7290658-fff8-4ee5-b8e5-eceefdc6beb6</guid><pubDate>Fri,  9 Feb 2018 11:47:30 +0100</pubDate><dc:creator>Jorge Aparicio</dc:creator></item><item><title>Experimenting with the New I/O Framework (in Rust) for embedded systems</title><link>http://pramode.in/2018/01/31/ti-launchpad-with-rust-new-io/</link><description>Notes on Code, by Pramode C.E</description><guid isPermaLink="false">d4191312-2442-4eb8-b313-67ba224829b6</guid><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jan 2018 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><dc:creator>Pramode C.E</dc:creator></item><item><title>Rust 2018: Improving Safety and Ergonomics for Low-Level Programming - Bobbin Blog</title><link>http://www.bobbin.io/blog/post/rust_2018_low_level/</link><description>There’s been a lot written about what can be done to make Rust’s tooling, libraries and infrastructure better for embedded programming, but I’d like to cover a slightly different topic: what can be done to make Rust the language itself safer and easier to use for low-level programming?</description><guid isPermaLink="false">d2189bca-0b13-451d-b70c-70ec43f7a207</guid><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jan 2018 14:00:00 -0400</pubDate><dc:creator>Jonathan Soo</dc:creator></item><item><title>Rust 2018: Core, Embedded+SIMD, Intermesiate documenation, Async • r/rust</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/7syxw4/rust_2018_core_embeddedsimd_intermesiate/</link><description>Hi there!
