On Jan 3 2018 the Rust blog put out a [call for community blog
posts][call-for-posts] in January that reflected on 2017 and proposed goals and
directions for Rust in 2018. Responses have flooded in across Twitter, Reddit,
and elsewhere.

Here you will find feeds that you can subscribe to in order to keep up with
new posts, no matter where they are published.

## Subscribe

## FAQ

### How do I submit a new post?

Adding new posts is a manual process. I generally update the feeds once or
twice a day. If the post is tweeted with the [#Rust2018] hash tag it will be
picked automatically when I update the feed. If the post is submitted
[/r/rust][rust-reddit] I should also notice it and include it.

For all other posts [create an issue in GitHub][add-post].

### How do I subscribe?

You subscribe to one of the feeds in a feed reader. Some options are shown
below. Personally I use and recommend [Feedbin] + [Reeder]:

* [Feedbin] (Web, Third party clients)
* [Feedly](https://feedly.com/) (Web, Third party clients)
* [Reeder] (iOS & macOS)
* [FeedReader](https://jangernert.github.io/FeedReader/) (Linux)
* [selfoss](https://selfoss.aditu.de/) (Self-hosted)
