It’s been a while since I’ve touched a compiled language as my day-to-day often deals with Python and Javascript variants. I was inspired after seeing a lot of interesting articles about Rust usage and decided to dive into learning Rust by creating a very basic 2D game, inspired by the classic Defender arcade game.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">c73d7d0b-4f7a-4448-acee-d98dbb499461</guid><pubDate>Fri,  2 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Andrew Huynh</dc:creator></item><item><title>Hairy Stuff</title><link>https://www.janwalter.org/jekyll/rendering/pbrt/2018/02/01/hairy-stuff.html</link><description>Last month I was working on a lot of new test scenes for my Rust implementation of the PBRT renderer. But a big chunk of my time went into implementing the curve shape needed for the geometry of hair, and a material, which implements a hair scattering model.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">b8c9dfda-526c-453c-a93b-5c96a207643e</guid><pubDate>Thu,  1 Feb 2018 13:30:00 +0100</pubDate><dc:creator>Jan Walter</dc:creator></item><item><title>Introduction to lyon: 2D vector graphics rendering on the GPU in Rust</title><link>https://nical.github.io/posts/lyon-intro.html</link><description>Lyon is a side-project that I have been working on for quite a while. The goal is to play with rendering 2D vector graphics on the GPU, and it&apos;s been a lot of fun so far. I haven&apos;t talked a lot about it online (except for a couple of reddit threads a year or two ago) so I figured it would be a good topic to get this blog started.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">0cced83f-3736-4917-87a0-408fb4d9f6bb</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><dc:creator>Nical</dc:creator></item></channel></rss>
