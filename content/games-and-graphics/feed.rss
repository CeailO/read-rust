One of these was the file named gameland.zip (not published yet, but I might put it up here some day.) I managed to get this running, and liked what I saw (you&apos;ll find the YouTube link to it further down on this page.) Around this time I was reading a bit about WebAssembly which I think will redefine and help reshape the web as we see it today. I was also looking at the Hello, Rust web page, and the &quot;FizzleFade effect using a Feistel network&quot; page in particular.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">86b2dfcd-a01d-47e1-acb8-2ddbca20db62</guid><pubDate>Tue, 13 Feb 2018 07:44:00 +1100</pubDate><dc:creator>Per Lundberg</dc:creator></item><item><title>RLSL (Rust -&gt; SPIR-V compiler) Progress report</title><link>https://maikklein.github.io/rlsl-progress-report/</link><description>This is a follow up post. RLSL is a Rust to SPIR-V compiler. SPIR-V is the shading language for Vulkan, similar to other shading languages like GLSL, HLSL but more low level. OpenGL, DX9/11/12, Vulkan, Metal are all graphic APIs that are able to use the GPU to draw pixels on the screen. Those APIs have certain stages that can be controlled by the developer by using the correct shading language.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">b8e85b25-1d33-4b69-a3ba-b2cbac2bf62e</guid><pubDate>Fri,  9 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Maik Klein</dc:creator></item><item><title>Adventures in Rust: A Basic 2D Game</title><link>https://a5huynh.github.io/2018/02/02/adventures-in-rust.html</link><description>In an effort to do more fun side projects, I’ve been learning Rust, a wonderful systems programming language developed by the Mozilla Foundation. It’s been a while since I’ve touched a compiled language as my day-to-day often deals with Python and Javascript variants. I was inspired after seeing a lot of interesting articles about Rust usage and decided to dive into learning Rust by creating a very basic 2D game, inspired by the classic Defender arcade game.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">c73d7d0b-4f7a-4448-acee-d98dbb499461</guid><pubDate>Fri,  2 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Andrew Huynh</dc:creator></item><item><title>Hairy Stuff</title><link>https://www.janwalter.org/jekyll/rendering/pbrt/2018/02/01/hairy-stuff.html</link><description>Last month I was working on a lot of new test scenes for my Rust implementation of the PBRT renderer. But a big chunk of my time went into implementing the curve shape needed for the geometry of hair, and a material, which implements a hair scattering model.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">b8c9dfda-526c-453c-a93b-5c96a207643e</guid><pubDate>Thu,  1 Feb 2018 13:30:00 +0100</pubDate><dc:creator>Jan Walter</dc:creator></item><item><title>Introduction to lyon: 2D vector graphics rendering on the GPU in Rust</title><link>https://nical.github.io/posts/lyon-intro.html</link><description>Lyon is a side-project that I have been working on for quite a while. The goal is to play with rendering 2D vector graphics on the GPU, and it&apos;s been a lot of fun so far. I haven&apos;t talked a lot about it online (except for a couple of reddit threads a year or two ago) so I figured it would be a good topic to get this blog started.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">0cced83f-3736-4917-87a0-408fb4d9f6bb</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><dc:creator>Nical</dc:creator></item></channel></rss>
