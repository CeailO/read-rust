Now, the company is developing its next game, code-named Witchbrook, using the Rust programming language instead of C++. Why the switch? Two main reasons: to get better performance on multiprocessor hardware and to have fewer crashes during game play.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">49014ace-e742-49f8-887a-8fa7d1b627cc</guid><pubDate>Mon, 23 Apr 2018 17:38:56 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>The Rust Project Developers</dc:creator></item><item><title>Writing An NES Emulator with Rust and WebAssembly</title><link>https://medium.com/@bokuweb17/writing-an-nes-emulator-with-rust-and-webassembly-d64de101c49d</link><description>I wrote the NES emulator with Rust and WebAssembly to learn Rust. It’s not perfect and have some audio bugs, but it’s good enough to play Super Mario bros.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">d65aaebc-e17b-421b-86e8-1cc9c63a0408</guid><pubDate>Wed, 11 Apr 2018 14:30:56 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>bokuweb</dc:creator></item><item><title>Taking the long road (Part 2): Rust bindings for a vector similarity search library</title><link>https://medium.com/@e_net4/taking-the-load-road-part-2-rust-bindings-for-a-vector-similarity-search-library-914fbc1ec5ed</link><description>This is part 2 of a story on taking the long road towards Rust bindings to Faiss. You may wish to read part 1 first for a motivation section and a deeper understanding of how I built a plain C API on top of the C++ library.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">cacf27d3-9206-414d-b28f-8745eec00a4a</guid><pubDate>Thu, 12 Apr 2018 20:11:12 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Eduardo Pinho</dc:creator></item><item><title>The State of Game Development in Rust</title><link>http://www.davideaversa.it/2018/02/state-game-development-rust/</link><description>Game Development is one of the fields in which Rust can gain a lot of traction.

Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) is the backbone concept, and provides exciting new ways to search for useful information. While the concept is no longer novel, the requirements imposed on systems for CBIR are ever increasing due to the increasingly larger amounts of data and demand for higher quality of retrieval.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">e5d47646-8715-43d3-a39b-23115255a1fe</guid><pubDate>Sat, 31 Mar 2018 15:45:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Eduardo Pinho</dc:creator></item><item><title>A geometric Rust adventure</title><link>https://eev.ee/blog/2018/03/30/a-geometric-rust-adventure/</link><description>The short version is: I have some shapes. I want to find their intersection.

Really, I want more than that: I want to drop them all on a canvas, intersect everything with everything, and pluck out all the resulting polygons. The input is a set of cookie cutters, and I want to press them all down on the same sheet of dough and figure out what all the resulting contiguous pieces are. And I want to know which cookie cutter(s) each piece came from.

But intersection is a good start.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">fe337d8c-3b02-4742-bfd0-59ac89d4234f</guid><pubDate>Fri, 30 Mar 2018 17:17:00 -0700</pubDate><dc:creator>Eevee</dc:creator></item><item><title>Roguelike Tutorial in Rust + tcod</title><link>https://tomassedovic.github.io/roguelike-tutorial/</link><description>Hello!

One of these was the file named gameland.zip (not published yet, but I might put it up here some day.) I managed to get this running, and liked what I saw (you&apos;ll find the YouTube link to it further down on this page.) Around this time I was reading a bit about WebAssembly which I think will redefine and help reshape the web as we see it today. I was also looking at the Hello, Rust web page, and the &quot;FizzleFade effect using a Feistel network&quot; page in particular.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">86b2dfcd-a01d-47e1-acb8-2ddbca20db62</guid><pubDate>Tue, 13 Feb 2018 07:44:00 +1100</pubDate><dc:creator>Per Lundberg</dc:creator></item><item><title>RLSL (Rust -&gt; SPIR-V compiler) Progress report</title><link>https://maikklein.github.io/rlsl-progress-report/</link><description>This is a follow up post. RLSL is a Rust to SPIR-V compiler. SPIR-V is the shading language for Vulkan, similar to other shading languages like GLSL, HLSL but more low level. OpenGL, DX9/11/12, Vulkan, Metal are all graphic APIs that are able to use the GPU to draw pixels on the screen. Those APIs have certain stages that can be controlled by the developer by using the correct shading language.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">b8e85b25-1d33-4b69-a3ba-b2cbac2bf62e</guid><pubDate>Fri,  9 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Maik Klein</dc:creator></item><item><title>Adventures in Rust: A Basic 2D Game</title><link>https://a5huynh.github.io/2018/02/02/adventures-in-rust.html</link><description>In an effort to do more fun side projects, I’ve been learning Rust, a wonderful systems programming language developed by the Mozilla Foundation. It’s been a while since I’ve touched a compiled language as my day-to-day often deals with Python and Javascript variants. I was inspired after seeing a lot of interesting articles about Rust usage and decided to dive into learning Rust by creating a very basic 2D game, inspired by the classic Defender arcade game.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">c73d7d0b-4f7a-4448-acee-d98dbb499461</guid><pubDate>Fri,  2 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Andrew Huynh</dc:creator></item><item><title>Hairy Stuff</title><link>https://www.janwalter.org/jekyll/rendering/pbrt/2018/02/01/hairy-stuff.html</link><description>Last month I was working on a lot of new test scenes for my Rust implementation of the PBRT renderer. But a big chunk of my time went into implementing the curve shape needed for the geometry of hair, and a material, which implements a hair scattering model.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">b8c9dfda-526c-453c-a93b-5c96a207643e</guid><pubDate>Thu,  1 Feb 2018 13:30:00 +0100</pubDate><dc:creator>Jan Walter</dc:creator></item><item><title>Introduction to lyon: 2D vector graphics rendering on the GPU in Rust</title><link>https://nical.github.io/posts/lyon-intro.html</link><description>Lyon is a side-project that I have been working on for quite a while. The goal is to play with rendering 2D vector graphics on the GPU, and it&apos;s been a lot of fun so far. I haven&apos;t talked a lot about it online (except for a couple of reddit threads a year or two ago) so I figured it would be a good topic to get this blog started.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">0cced83f-3736-4917-87a0-408fb4d9f6bb</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><dc:creator>Nical</dc:creator></item></channel></rss>
