But a big chunk of my time went into implementing the curve shape needed for the geometry of hair, and a material, which implements a hair scattering model.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">b8c9dfda-526c-453c-a93b-5c96a207643e</guid><pubDate>Thu,  1 Feb 2018 13:30:00 +0100</pubDate><dc:creator>Jan Walter</dc:creator></item><item><title>Introduction to lyon: 2D vector graphics rendering on the GPU in Rust</title><link>https://nical.github.io/posts/lyon-intro.html</link><description>Lyon is a side-project that I have been working on for quite a while.
