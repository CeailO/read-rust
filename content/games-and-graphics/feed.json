      "content_text": "In my first post about my journey to the center of the NES, I was at the point where I was still working on the CPU; implementing new addressing modes and instructions as I made my way through the nestest ROM. Well, I finally finished the CPU, including a handful of the illegal opcodes. The last of the illegal opcodes just need some placeholders, because, as I understand it, very few games use them.",

      "content_text": "In my last post on optimising my Rust path tracer with SIMD I had got withing 10% of my performance target, that is Aras’s C++ SSE4.1 path tracer. From profiling I had determined that the main differences were MSVC using SSE versions of sinf and cosf and differences between Rayon and enkiTS thread pools. The first thing I tried was implement an SSE2 version of sin_cos based off of Julien Pommier’s code that I found via a bit of googling. This was enough to get my SSE4.1 implementation to match the performance of Aras’s SSE4.1 code. I had a slight advantage in that I just call sin_cos as a single function versus separate sin and cos functions, but meh, I’m calling my performance target reached.\n\nThe other part of this post is about Rust’s runtime and compile time CPU feature detection and some wrong turns I took along the way.",

While the concept is no longer novel, the requirements imposed on systems for CBIR are ever increasing due to the increasingly larger amounts of data and demand for higher quality of retrieval.",
