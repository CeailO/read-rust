      "content_text": "Perhaps you have once wondered how search engines such as Google and TinEye enable their users to search for images which are similar to one that you provide, or how they can identify a building from nothing but a picture. Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) is the backbone concept, and provides exciting new ways to search for useful information. While the concept is no longer novel, the requirements imposed on systems for CBIR are ever increasing due to the increasingly larger amounts of data and demand for higher quality of retrieval.",

The input is a set of cookie cutters, and I want to press them all down on the same sheet of dough and figure out what all the resulting contiguous pieces are. And I want to know which cookie cutter(s) each piece came from.\n\nBut intersection is a good start.",

One of these was the file named gameland.zip (not published yet, but I might put it up here some day.) I managed to get this running, and liked what I saw (you'll find the YouTube link to it further down on this page.) Around this time I was reading a bit about WebAssembly which I think will redefine and help reshape the web as we see it today. I was also looking at the Hello, Rust web page, and the \"FizzleFade effect using a Feistel network\" page in particular.",

OpenGL, DX9/11/12, Vulkan, Metal are all graphic APIs that are able to use the GPU to draw pixels on the screen. Those APIs have certain stages that can be controlled by the developer by using the correct shading language.",

It’s been a while since I’ve touched a compiled language as my day-to-day often deals with Python and Javascript variants. I was inspired after seeing a lot of interesting articles about Rust usage and decided to dive into learning Rust by creating a very basic 2D game, inspired by the classic Defender arcade game.",
