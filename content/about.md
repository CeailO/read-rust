Read Rust collects interesting posts about or related to the [Rust programming
language][rust-lang]. It is run by [Wesley Moore][wezm] with contributions
from the Rust community. You can [follow me on Twitter][@wezm] or [Mastodon].

Read Rust is an open source project. The [source code][source] and [issue
tracker][issues] are hosted on GitHub.

<h2 id="feeds">Feeds</h2>

I am a proponent of the open web and as a result the content of Read Rust is
available in a number of machine readable formats. There are feeds available
for the whole site, as well as each of the categories:

* Main feed: [RSS](/feed.rss) [JSON](feed.json)
* Rust 2018: [RSS](/rust2018/feed.rss) [JSON](/rust2018/feed.json)

I order to discover new posts I subscribe to a lot of Rust related RSS feeds.
The list is available in [OPML] (readily importable into [feed readers](/faq.html#subscribe)) and JSON:

* Blog list: [OPML](/rust-blogs.opml) [JSON]()

## Social Media

Read Rust also has an account on Twitter: [@read_rust], which tweets
each newly added post. Incidentally it's driven by the RSS feed.
