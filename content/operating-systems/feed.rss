This merge means you can now experiment with basic ptrace functionality using only basic registers and PTRACE_SYSCALL/PTRACE_SINGLESTEP. I have already opened the second PR in the batch: Ptrace memory reading and floating point registers support which will supply the “final bits” of the initial implementation, before all the nitpicking of final concerns can start (not to underestimate the importance and difficulty of these nitpicks - there are some areas of ptrace that aren’t even thought about yet and those will need tending to)! I will comment on these changes in this blog post, as there are some interesting things going on!]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">dc58ea4c-1cea-4142-b9e7-00e066527e35</guid><pubDate>Sun,  7 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>jD91mZM2</dc:creator></item><item><title>RSoC: Ion as a Library, week 5</title><link>https://www.redox-os.org/news/rsoc-ion-lib-4/</link><description><![CDATA[Wrapping up the Ion as a library project. It is now possible to embed Ion in any Rust application. Ion takes any Read instance and can execute it (so yes, it is possible to run Ion without ever collecting the script’s binary stream). It takes care of expanding the input and managing the running applications in an efficient manner, with a comprehensive set of errors.

Since the kernel must be able to handle system-calls of processes, it’s quite obvious that the way to set a breakpoint should involve the kernel, running in the context of the tracee, should notify the tracer and wait. So the biggest challenge would be to figure out how kernel synchronization worked.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">a3749f41-8d22-4fa8-9f5d-bb1e699f333c</guid><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>jD91mZM2</dc:creator></item><item><title>Writing an OS in Rust: Heap Allocation</title><link>https://os.phil-opp.com/heap-allocation/</link><description><![CDATA[This post adds support for heap allocation to our kernel.

By doing so, this should demonstrate how to bootstrap writing your own Fuse file system in Rust.

The OS is increasingly a bottleneck for server applications that want to take maximum advantage of the hardware. Many traditional kernel interfaces (such as in POSIX) were designed when I/O was significantly slower than the CPU. However, today I/O is getting faster, but single-threaded CPU performance has stagnated. For example, a 40 GbE NIC can receive a cache-line sized packet faster than the CPU can access its last-level cache (LLC), which makes it tricky for an OS to keep up with packets arriving from the network. Similarly, non-volatile memory (NVM) access speed is getting closer to DRAM speeds, which challenges OS abstractions for storage.

To address this OS bottleneck, server applications are increasingly adopting kernel-bypass techniques. For example, the Seastar framework is an OS implemented in userspace, which implements its own CPU and I/O scheduler, and bypasses the Linux kernel as much as it can. Parakernel is an OS architecture that eliminates many OS abstractions (similar to exokernels) and partitions hardware resources (similar to multikernels) to facilitate high-performance server application with increased application-level parallelism and predictable tail latency.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">0650fe18-12a0-40f4-916f-1a5c2464b9d5</guid><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Pekka Enberg</dc:creator></item><item><title>rust-hypervisor-firmware</title><link>https://github.com/intel/rust-hypervisor-firmware/blob/master/README.md</link><description><![CDATA[This repository contains a simple KVM firmware that is designed to be launched from anything that supports loading ELF binaries and running them with the Linux kernel loading standard.

Naturally after building Minix from git, the first thing I decided to try was porting Rust’s std to Minix so I could cross-compile Rust programs from Linux to run under Minix. Okay, I suppose I could have started with something else, but porting Rust software and modifying the platform-depending part of std is something I have experience with from working on Redox OS.

Rust is nowadays written in Rust. We've tracked down the earlier Rust versions, which were written in OCaml, and were planning to use these to bootstrap Rust. But in parallel, John Hudge (Mutabah) developed a Rust compiler, called "mrustc", written in C++. mrustc is now good enough to compile Rust 1.19.0.

The next step was to implement a clean read API which can be used by different filesystem libraries in order to read their respective filesystems. Since the raw reads from the BIOS interrupt had a granularity in terms of sectors(each sector being 512 bytes), the reads had to be translated in order to provide byte level granularity. The clone_from_slice function ensures that a direct call to memcopy is not required. The refined read function is here.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">6f2abec2-1096-4a82-90db-b1962a2876f7</guid><pubDate>Thu,  9 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Deepak Sirone</dc:creator></item><item><title>RSoC: Porting Redox to ARM (AArch64) — 0x02</title><link>https://medium.com/@wizofe/rsoc-porting-redox-to-arm-aarch64-0x02-c566ee22f377</link><description><![CDATA[At the time of writing the previous blog the plan was to target the Raspberry Pi 3 (Cortex A53) as a development platform because of its availability, popularity and community.

Most of the time was spent on one bug, and after that one was figured out and fixed it ended up being relatively easy! As of now, 11⁄13 tokio examples seem to work on redox. The remaining examples are UDP and seem to fail because of something either with the rust standard library or my setup.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">4c951443-54b3-4187-8791-b27502ff193b</guid><pubDate>Mon, 21 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>jD91mZM2</dc:creator></item><item><title>Writing an OS in Rust: Unit Testing</title><link>https://os.phil-opp.com/unit-testing/</link><description><![CDATA[This post explores unit testing in no_std executables using Rust's built-in test framework.

We are looking for both Students and Sponsors who want to help Redox OS grow. At the moment, Redox OS has $10,800 in donations from various platforms to use to fund students. This will give us three students working for three months, if each student requests $1200 per month on average as described in Payment.

In order to fund more students, we are looking for sponsors who are willing to fund RSoC. Donations can be made on the Donate page. All donations will be used to fund Redox OS activities, with about 90% of those over the past year currently allocated to RSoC.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">a4be83a4-b126-479a-bfca-81e7d612d2b3</guid><pubDate>Sat, 14 Apr 2018 21:10:05 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Jeremy Soller</dc:creator></item><item><title>New Pop!_OS Testing Release with Rust based Linux installer &quot;distinst&quot;</title><link>https://system76.com/pop/testing</link><description><![CDATA[Our second iteration of the 18.04 ISO is ready for testing.
