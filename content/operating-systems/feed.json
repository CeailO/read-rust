In addition, the user applications are still compiled by our cross-compiler, which is based on gcc and supports C, C++, Fortran, and Go. The core of the kernel, however, is now written in Rust and published at GitHub. Our experiences so far are really good and we are looking into possibly new Rust activities, e.g., the support for Rust’s userland.",
