Most changes this week was related to getting decent behavior of child processes, although the design feels… suboptimal, somehow (not sure why), so I feel I must be able to improve it better later.\n\nAnother change was security: Tracers running as a non-root user can now in addition to only tracing processes running as the same user, only trace processes that are directly or indirectly children of the tracer. In the future this can easily be allowed with some kind of capability, but currently in Redox there isn’t a capability-like system other than the simple (but really powerful) namespacing system which sadly I don’t think can be used for this.",

      "content_text": "Manticore is a research operating system, written in Rust, with the aim of exploring the parakernel OS architecture.\n\nThe OS is increasingly a bottleneck for server applications that want to take maximum advantage of the hardware. Many traditional kernel interfaces (such as in POSIX) were designed when I/O was significantly slower than the CPU. However, today I/O is getting faster, but single-threaded CPU performance has stagnated. For example, a 40 GbE NIC can receive a cache-line sized packet faster than the CPU can access its last-level cache (LLC), which makes it tricky for an OS to keep up with packets arriving from the network. Similarly, non-volatile memory (NVM) access speed is getting closer to DRAM speeds, which challenges OS abstractions for storage.\n\nTo address this OS bottleneck, server applications are increasingly adopting kernel-bypass techniques. For example, the Seastar framework is an OS implemented in userspace, which implements its own CPU and I/O scheduler, and bypasses the Linux kernel as much as it can. Parakernel is an OS architecture that eliminates many OS abstractions (similar to exokernels) and partitions hardware resources (similar to multikernels) to facilitate high-performance server application with increased application-level parallelism and predictable tail latency.",

The next step was to implement a clean read API which can be used by different filesystem libraries in order to read their respective filesystems. Since the raw reads from the BIOS interrupt had a granularity in terms of sectors(each sector being 512 bytes), the reads had to be translated in order to provide byte level granularity. The clone_from_slice function ensures that a direct call to memcopy is not required. The refined read function is here.",

The quality of this board is definitely a lot better than the Raspberry Pi and the documentation is detailed and open. Great stuff.",
