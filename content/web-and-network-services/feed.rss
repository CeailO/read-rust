In this post, I’d like to explore a little bit of the inner workings of how we can communicate between Rust (wasm) and JavaScript. As I mentioned in the last post, WebAssembly is neither JavaScript nor some strongly-typed dialect. It is a standalone, compiled, portable binary. How you send data into and get data out of that binary involves some subtle nuances about how WebAssembly works.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">fc25e5f3-66d9-429d-8ca8-c1882a5083d6</guid><pubDate>Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:14:05 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Kevin Hoffman</dc:creator></item><item><title>The case for deadlines</title><link>https://gist.github.com/alkis/9510a840f1965185ab0a02cb59761dd8</link><description>Rust aims to be the foundation of fast and robust software.

Their use-case was basically to receive an as-high-as-possible number of audio RTP streams over UDP, transcode them, and then send them out via UDP again. Due to how GStreamer usually works, they were running into some performance issues.

This blog post will describe the first set of improvements that were implemented for this use-case, together with a minimal benchmark and the results. My colleague Mathieu will follow up with one or two other blog posts with the other improvements and a more full-featured benchmark.

The short version is that CPU usage decreased by about 65-75%, i.e. allowing 3-4x more streams with the same CPU usage. Also parallelization works better and usage of different CPU cores is more controllable, allowing for better scalability. And a fixed, but configurable number of threads is used, which is independent of the number of streams.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">98f65a4a-8501-45e4-bda8-48d5d01306ba</guid><pubDate>Thu,  5 Apr 2018 15:21:06 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Sebastian Dröge</dc:creator></item><item><title>HTTP upgrades with hyper</title><link>http://seanmonstar.com/post/172531530657/http-upgrades-with-hyper</link><description>The newest release of hyper includes some lower-level connection APIs for both the server and client.

I coded mob into a mostly working state and then left it mostly alone, only updating it to work with the latest stable mio. Recently, I started looking at the code again and had the urge to improve it. In a previous post, I talked about managing the state of connections in mob. In this post, I will walk through what I did to remove the need to track connection state. I wanted to remove the state because the implementation required an O(n) operation every tick of the mio event loop. It also added a fair amount of complexity to the code.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">d14f3e75-4047-441e-a67b-fc0de042845a</guid><pubDate>Thu, 29 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Herman J.

They’re fast and fun to work in at small scale, but when you have a project that gets big, their attractive veneer quickly washes away. A big Ruby or JavaScript (just to name a few) program in production is a never ending game of whack-a-mock – you fix one problem only to find a new one somewhere else. No matter how many tests you write, or how well-disciplined your team, any new development is sure to introduce a stream of bugs that will need to be shored up over the course of months or years.

Central to the problem are the edges. People will reliably do a good job of building and testing the happy paths, but as humans we’re terrible at considering the edge conditions, and it’s those edges and corners that cause trouble over the years that a program is in service.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">9f012379-d71a-4c45-b9db-12c4871070e7</guid><pubDate>Tue, 27 Mar 2018 14:45:57 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Brandur Leach</dc:creator></item><item><title>Building a Restful CRUD API with Rust</title><link>https://medium.com/sean3z/building-a-restful-crud-api-with-rust-1867308352d8</link><description>Since my initial Node/Rust REST comparison, I’ve wanted to follow up with a comprehensive guide for getting simple CRUD operations up and running in Rust.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">e32bb679-4afa-48d9-ab51-d589a590348e</guid><pubDate>Mon, 19 Mar 2018 04:29:33 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Sean Wragg</dc:creator></item><item><title>Multicasting in Rust</title><link>https://bluejekyll.github.io/blog/rust/2018/03/18/multicasting-in-rust.html</link><description>A brief post to help others multicast in Rust</description><guid isPermaLink="false">dae19f32-236c-4329-b26d-e6c47b2631d3</guid><pubDate>Sun, 18 Mar 2018 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Benjamin Fry</dc:creator></item><item><title>Building a DNS server in Rust</title><link>https://github.com/EmilHernvall/dnsguide</link><description>With the combined goal of gaining a deep understanding of DNS, of doing something interesting with Rust, and of scratching some of my own itches, I originally set out to implement my own DNS server.

I’ve been a reasonably active member of the C++ community for quite a while now, attending and contributing talks to conferences, following the development and evangelism of the language’s more modern features and of course writing lots of it. C++ is a language that gives its users very fine-grained control over all aspects of the program they are writing, at the cost of a steep learning curve and a large body of knowledge required to write effective C++. However, C++ is also a very old language, conceived by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1985, and thus caries a lot of technical debt even into modern standards.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">776dd5f1-c6d0-48da-8e0a-6fcae00fb923</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Peter Goldsborough</dc:creator></item><item><title>Speed Without Wizardry</title><link>http://fitzgeraldnick.com/2018/02/26/speed-without-wizardry.html</link><description>Vyacheslav Egorov, who goes by mraleph on the Web, wrote a response to my article “Oxidizing Source Maps with Rust and WebAssembly” titled “Maybe you don’t need Rust and WASM to speed up your JS”.

The “Oxidizing” article recounts my experience integrating Rust (compiled to WebAssembly) into the source-map JavaScript library. Although the JavaScript implementation was originally authored in idiomatic JavaScript style, as we profiled and implemented speed improvements, the code became hard to read and maintain. With Rust and its zero-cost abstractions, we found that there was no trade-off between performance and clean code.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">26bc7432-d561-4e1f-8cf2-2c30b8ac63ab</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Feb 2018 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate><dc:creator>Nick Fitzgerald</dc:creator></item><item><title>Recently, for a Rusty Web</title><link>http://seanmonstar.com/post/171170905822/recently-for-a-rusty-web</link><description>It’s been a few months since I shifted my focus full time to Rust, and in that time, we’ve gotten a lot of work done!
