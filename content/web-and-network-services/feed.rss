I spent quite a bit of time learning about REST APIs and, as part of these exercises, implemented skeletons of REST servers in both Go and Rust. The app prototypes have gone nowhere but I thought of sharing the skeletons I built if only to serve as templates for myself in future work. Thus, in this post, I will cover these skeleton demos and I will compare them.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">dcbe1901-b9b1-4eec-a44e-d6be0dcdd958</guid><pubDate>Fri, 27 Sep 2019 06:45:40 +0500</pubDate><dc:creator>Julio Merino</dc:creator></item><item><title>How to use routers in Rust Frontend</title><link>https://www.steadylearner.com/blog/read/How-to-use-routers-in-Rust-Frontend</link><description><![CDATA[In the previous post How to use a modal in Rust, we learnt how to write a simple image modal with Rust frontend.

This is a big deal. Rust has already has popular crates (tokio, actix) that provide asynchronous concurrency, but the async syntax coming to stable in 1.39 is much, much more approachable. My experience has been that you can produce and reason about application flow much more easily, which has made me significantly more productive when dealing with highly concurrent systems. To kick the tires of this new syntax I dug into the nightly branch, and built a high-performance TCP client called clobber. In this post I'll talk about why I think async/await in Rust is a big deal, and walk you some of the code in clobber.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">b577a6bb-429a-454b-8d2b-77175dba68c8</guid><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Ryan Ragona</dc:creator></item><item><title>Rustacean Terminal Chat App in Rust</title><link>https://www.pubnub.com/blog/build-realtime-rust-chat-app-cursive-tui/</link><description><![CDATA[Build a basic chat app with the Rust Programming Language.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">e21ad158-7d23-47c3-82a4-0f76f651c6d9</guid><pubDate>Fri,  9 Aug 2019 17:31:52 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Samba Diallo</dc:creator></item><item><title>Practical Networked Applications in Rust, Part 2: Networked Key-Value Store</title><link>https://arveknudsen.com/posts/practical-networked-applications-in-rust/module-2/</link><description><![CDATA[Welcome to the second installation in my series on taking the Practical Networked Applications in Rust course, kindly provided by the PingCAP company, where you develop a networked and multithreaded/asynchronous key-value store in the amazing Rust language. In the previous, and initial, post I implemented the course module of making the fundamental key-value store functionality, based around the Bitcask algorithm, which would only allow for local usage on your own computer.

I have also been gaining experience with Kubernetes recently and I could clearly see how this would simplify the creation of a distributed platform.

At the end of Part 1 of this tutorial, our server will do the following: Listen for and handle TCP connections on a specific port, Accept HTTP 1.0 GET requests, Parse and validate requests for further use, Log incoming requests. We will avoid using libraries that make this trivial (i.e. the http crate) and focus on the fundamentals of how a server works.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">25d9490f-05e3-4f5c-a407-19d78b0fb6d4</guid><pubDate>Sat, 11 May 2019 17:17:46 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Levi Payne</dc:creator></item><item><title>Unit testing Rust using Chrome</title><link>https://medium.com/visly/unit-testing-rust-using-chrome-b8b93572a91d</link><description><![CDATA[Stretch is a cross-platform Flexbox engine written in Rust. At Visly we are building a design tool for front-end engineers and we needed to ensure components looked the same across web, iOS, and Android without making use of WebViews.

In this post, I’ll cover the test setup we use in Stretch, how and why we need to generate unit dynamically. I’ll also cover an example of contributing another test to Stretch, and finally I’ll walk through how we also make use of this system for benchmarking.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">ffeaa8e5-849b-4924-9c9f-1ac6adc15a8e</guid><pubDate>Mon,  6 May 2019 16:25:41 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Emil Sjölander</dc:creator></item><item><title>WebAssembly -Part II.A | Wasm with Rust</title><link>https://medium.com/tech-lah/webassembly-part-ii-a-wasm-with-rust-2356dbc6526e</link><description><![CDATA[This article is more of a how-to on getting up and running with a production-grade web project which incorporates Rust (or any other language for that matter) and WebAssembly into your web pages.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">e3fadb7b-df84-47a1-b6ca-47186b2b9418</guid><pubDate>Sun,  5 May 2019 13:27:01 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Francisco Vilches</dc:creator></item><item><title>Introducing Lightbeam: An Optimising Streaming WebAssembly Compiler</title><link>http://troubles.md/posts/lightbeam/</link><description><![CDATA[Lightbeam is a new streaming compiler for WebAssembly, designed to produce the best possible assembly while still being fast enough to produce assembly faster than the WebAssembly is received over the wire.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">f6902c1c-3975-454f-891e-d39b071d66d4</guid><pubDate>Sat,  4 May 2019 10:10:34 +0100</pubDate><dc:creator>troubles.md</dc:creator></item><item><title>Building Simple APIs with Hyper and Usher</title><link>https://whitfin.io/building-simple-apis-with-hyper-and-usher/</link><description><![CDATA[When writing a web service, I often lean towards using tools that are as minimal as possible. One pretty obvious reason for this is the avoidance of dependencies you either don't want or don't need in your project. Whilst I'm not someone who goes out of their way to avoid dependencies, this is a pain point particularly in Rust because of the cost of building them repeatedly rather than shipping extra interpreted files around (especially if you use "pure" build environments).]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">728cc414-7e29-41ce-86af-0181095c3ec6</guid><pubDate>Fri,  3 May 2019 16:56:26 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Isaac Whitfield</dc:creator></item><item><title>Explained: Futures in Rust for Web Development</title><link>https://dev.to/gruberb/explained-rust-futures-for-web-development-a10</link><description><![CDATA[If you are coming from NodeJS, Futures in Rust don't make much sense. In NodeJS, everything happens asynchronously. Therefore for you to be able to say "Hey, I really need to wait for the answer for this GET HTTP call", you are putting.then() on a Promise, so you can make sure you just execute the code inside the .then() when the HTTP call is finished.

In Rust, everything is blocking and synchronous by default, so you might ask yourself: "Why bothering with the complexity, that's exactly what I wanted in the first place!"]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">9152c867-9b24-49d0-ac2c-d85775162eb4</guid><pubDate>Thu,  2 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Bastian Gruber</dc:creator></item><item><title>Hawk: Image Recognition Application using Rust and AWS Services</title><link>https://blog.knoldus.com/hawk-image-recognition-project-using-rust-and-aws-services/</link><description><![CDATA[Rust is one of the newest kid on the block in the modern programming languages.

As far as communication with JavaScript went, you had to work with raw wasm imports and exports yourself. That meant you could only pass 32- and 64-bit integers and floats back and forth. No Rust structs, JavaScript objects, strings, or slices could be passed back forth. And distributing your library’s .wasm so that other downstream projects could depend on it? Good luck.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">c0eb769f-4785-436d-b0b9-4bff16b30ef8</guid><pubDate>Thu,  6 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Rust and WebAssembly</dc:creator></item><item><title>Wherefore art thou Romio?</title><link>http://boats.gitlab.io/blog/post/romio/</link><description><![CDATA[This blog post is about a project called Romio that I’ve been working on over the past two or three weeks.
