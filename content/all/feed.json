      "content_text": "Last week, I went to the fifth Rust+GNOME hackfest which was in Berlin again. My goal for this hackfest was to fix this issue I opened nearly three years ago. The problem is that sometimes you want to create a widget or an object and set some properties at construction time. This might be needed when you want to set construct-only properties. For instance, you might want to create a webkit2gtk::WebView with a WebContext and a UserContentManager at the same time. That’s why a constructor was manually written for this use case.",

      "content_text": "Manticore is a research operating system, written in Rust, with the aim of exploring the parakernel OS architecture.\n\nThe OS is increasingly a bottleneck for server applications that want to take maximum advantage of the hardware. Many traditional kernel interfaces (such as in POSIX) were designed when I/O was significantly slower than the CPU. However, today I/O is getting faster, but single-threaded CPU performance has stagnated. For example, a 40 GbE NIC can receive a cache-line sized packet faster than the CPU can access its last-level cache (LLC), which makes it tricky for an OS to keep up with packets arriving from the network. Similarly, non-volatile memory (NVM) access speed is getting closer to DRAM speeds, which challenges OS abstractions for storage.\n\nTo address this OS bottleneck, server applications are increasingly adopting kernel-bypass techniques. For example, the Seastar framework is an OS implemented in userspace, which implements its own CPU and I/O scheduler, and bypasses the Linux kernel as much as it can. Parakernel is an OS architecture that eliminates many OS abstractions (similar to exokernels) and partitions hardware resources (similar to multikernels) to facilitate high-performance server application with increased application-level parallelism and predictable tail latency.",

You can generally find them alongside the library header files (as you can see here for example, look for “.gir”).\n\nThe .gir files “describes” the library API (objects, arguments, even ownership!). This is where the gir crate comes in: it reads those .gir files and generates the Rust crates from them. You can learn more about the GIR format here.",

In this work, we examine how this aspect of Rust's type system impacts the development and refinement of a concurrent data structure, as well as its ability to adapt to situations where correctness is guaranteed by lower-level invariants (e.g., in lock-free algorithms) that are not directly expressible in the type system itself. We detail the implementation of a concurrent lock-free hashmap in order to describe these traits of the Rust language.",

The functions can then be loaded from the Vulkan dynamic library and other functions from the API.\n\nHowever using a raw C API isn’t easy in Rust because it requires using a lot of unsafe code. This is why we’ll also generate builders for all structs so we can for instance fill in pointer/size pairs using slices, but we’ll also generate methods that return Rust’s Results and take in Rust-friendly types like references instead of raw C types. Finally we’ll also generate loaders so we don’t have to manually load the function we need.<Paste>",

As such, it takes an input video and encodes it to produce a valid AV1 bitstream. Tile encoding consists in splitting video frames into tiles that can be encoded and decoded independently in parallel (to use several CPUs), at the cost of a small loss in compression efficiency. This speeds up encoding and increases decoding frame rate.",

Rust is a very fast language that also works to ensure safety from a group of bugs and pitfalls. It’s also the four-time-running most loved programming language, according to a yearly Stack Overflow survey. Also, since Rust is only a few years old, any program written in Rust is by definition new. Of course newer doesn’t always mean better, but as a non-professional developer I can afford to be on the edge a bit.",

      "content_text": "The majority of my async programming experience is on iOS and let me tell you, life is good. You can easily dispatch work to background threads. You can bring work back to the main thread. You can mark your classes as delegates and when you need to handle some event the OS will use a magic pre-existing thread pool to invoke your method and you can do whatever you like. It works perfectly almost all the time, except for when it doesn’t because of race conditions or it crashes due to concurrency. Life is good.\n\nRust is less tolerant about the crashing part. While I agree that crashing is bad in principle, avoiding it has significant ramifications for how you can write async code at all. Recently I’ve been finding out what the differences are. Obviously this means I’m more of a noob than an expert, but I’m currently in a good position to point out what the confusing parts are and what the Rust solutions seem to be. (But I’m a noob so take it with a grain of salt.)",

You can picture them mentally by several small and simple curves combined to each others, giving the curve an interesting shape and properties. Now why we want splines is easy to understand: imagine a curve, something smooth and a bit complex (maybe even with loops). Now, imagine you want to make an object move along that curve. How do you represent that curve and how to you “make something advance along it?”",

Being mostly familiar with untyped languages like Ruby and JavaScript, it’s interesting to learn a statically typed language and see how it changes how one writes programs. There’s a common misconception amongst dynamic typing fans that static typing means you write the same programs, they’re just more verbose and come with more restrictions. And while there is certainly a cost to only being allowed to write type-safe programs, a good type system actually lets you write programs you cannot write in dynamic languages. In Rust, generic return values are a good example of this.",

It’s easy to have those proposals change from “Option A” vs “Option B” to “my option” and “their option”. Once this happens, it can be very hard to let them “win” – even if you know that both options are quite reasonable.\n\nThis is a problem I’ve been thinking a lot about lately. So I wanted to start an irregular series of blog posts entitled “Adventures in consensus”, or AiC for short. These posts are my way of exploring the topic, and hopefully getting some feedback from all of you while I’m at it.\n\nThis first post dives into what a phrase like “finding the best solution” even means (is there a best?) as well as the mechanics of how one might go about deciding if you really have the “best” solution. Along the way, we’ll see a few places where I think our current process could do better.",

In this post I’ll describe the call graph metadata I’m currently implementing in rustc and how it will help tools like cargo-call-stack. By the way, I have a feature branch of cargo-call-stack that uses this upcoming rustc feature if you want to try it out but you’ll need to build a custom rustc.",

It is the most minimal design I have seen proposed and is, in my eyes, the first plausible design for such abstractions — those commonly known as “higher-kinded types”. This approach depends on a very minimal extension to Rust’s type system. In particular, this approach avoids the need for either higher-kinded types (e.g. as in this design) or full abstraction over traits (e.g. “traits for traits”). Most of the design challenges are tackled directly using existing features.",

The Rust compiler relieves a great deal of the cognitive burden associated with memory management, but we’re going to step into its world for a while.\n\nLet’s learn a bit about memory in Rust.",

I used Apache Arrow's Rust library (which I've started contributing to this year) to do that. The idea was simple, Arrow has a CSV reader that can infer schema, so I map the schema's data types to a database's types, and then I sequentially write records in batches to the database.\n\nI found the exercise quite painful, so I'd like to talk about databases and Rust.",

A question was raised by @matklad on GitHub, \"I've migrated rust-analyzer to crossbeam-channel 0.3, and the thing I've noticed is that every .send is followed by .unwrap.

While you can use the command line tool or the library to solve some small and easy SAT problems now, there is still a lot ahead to gain feature and performance parity with varisat 0.1.\n\nIn the last post we saw how unit propagation is implemented. When some variables are known, unit propagation allows us to derive the values of new variables or finds a clause that cannot be satisfied. Unit propagation alone isn’t enough though, as there is no guarantee to make progress. To continue the search for a satisfying solution after propagating all assignments, it is necessary to make a guess. A natural way to handle this would be recursion and backtracking. This would give us a variant of the DPLL algorithm from which conflict driven clause learning evolved.",

      "content_text": "Rust is a major advancement in industrial programming languages due in large part to its success in bridging the gap between low-level systems programming and high-level application programming. This success has ultimately empowered programmers to more easily build reliable and efficient software, and at its heart lies a novel approach to ownership that balances type system expressivity with usability.\n\nIn this work, we set out to capture the essence of this model of ownership by developing a type systems account of Rust's borrow checker. To that end, we present Oxide, a formalized programming language close to source-level Rust (but with fully-annotated types). This presentation takes a new view of lifetimes as approximate provenances of references, and our type system is able to automatically compute this information through a flow-sensitive substructural typing judgment for which we prove syntactic type safety using progress and preservation. The result is a simpler formulation of borrow checking - including recent features such as non-lexical lifetimes - that we hope researchers will be able to use as the basis for work on Rust.",

The third post, which I never finished, was going to talk about the datastructures and algorithms used in pijul, a version control system built around that new framework. The problem is that pijul is a complex piece of software, and so I had lots of trouble wrapping my head around it.\n\nTwo years later, I’m finally ready to continue with this series of posts (but having learned from my earlier mistakes, I’m not going to predict the total number of posts ahead of time). In the meantime, I’ve written my own toy version control system (VCS) to help me understand what’s going on. It’s called ojo, and it’s extremely primitive: to start with, it can only track a single file. However, it is (just barely) sophisticated enough to demonstrate the important ideas. I’m also doing my best to make the code is clear and well-documented.",

In Rust land we have Zola, which is feature-rich, mature (for v0.5), and definitely fast enough for most users, and yet it is not as fast as it could be.

It repeatedly chooses a pixel to “collapse” - choosing a tile to use for that pixel based on its distribution. WFC gets its name from quantum physics.

So ideally, to check my passwords against the big list, I’d have a tool that checks all the passwords in a given KeePass database against the entire HaveIBeenPwned list of passwords, preferably against the downloaded file (i.e. “offline”), rather than the API. In other words something similar to 1Password’s Watchtower feature, but preferably offline.\n\nAfter poking around a bit I decided to write it myself in Rust, with this script and this crate as useful references. Medic is a Rust CLI that can perform a variety of “health” checks on a KeePass database.",

Additionally, I decided to write the database in Rust, since I knew there would be complicated management of data, and I wanted to avoid headaches involving invalid data. Finally, rust’s static garbage collector meant I wouldn’t have to rely on a runtime to guarantee this.\n\nThat was a month ago.

Yes, strong typing prevents you from common pitfalls, and C++ can go quite far in this direction (as many JS/Python enthusiastic will gladly testify). It is often easy to forget how it sometimes prevents you from writing a completely legal and safe code, due to rules being too “protective”. And as Rust takes the code safety to a whole new level, sometimes a trivial code can’t be written, and without the proper knowledge, it might seem entirely arbitrary. It was a subtle restriction in the builder pattern that took me by surprise first.",

A lot of the comments I’ve seen on social media boil down to “The problem isn’t the use of a memory unsafe language, but that the programmers who wrote this code are bad.”\n\nIn this article, I’m going to look at a recent bug that was caught by the Rust compiler, which I think shows that not only is this assertion unreasonable but virtually impossible for reasons I haven’t seen discussed. While the example I’m going to give is about thread safety rather than memory safety, the arguments I’m going to present can be applied to both.",

With the Rust All hands in Berlin only a few weeks away I wanted to get my thoughts in order by writing out some of the solutions to specific problems I came up with. Now, this doesn't mean they'll be accepted! We might even find better solutions! I just felt a need to articulate them as both a reference point and to make sure I've thought through them well.

Typically when you have an example of how the program should behave you write an example-based unit test. Ideally, each of them would represent an isolated example and they should fail independently. But, converting your source data files into a unit test one by one, manually, can be a bit tedious. Rust build scripts to the rescue !",

Personally I think this is a very profound thought, that the goal of a programming language is to help others to do and achieve things they never thought possible.\n\nJavaScript empowers developers by being accessible - everyone can start and succeed quickly. It’s great. Rust on the other hand empowers developers by giving them the tools to go deep.\n\nLet’s unpack that.",

This has meant that I'm running into all the cases where the original C code in librsvg failed to handle errors properly; Rust really makes it obvious when that happens.\n\nIn this post I want to talk a bit about propagating errors.

      "content_text": "Rust’s type system ensures memory safety: well-typed Rust programs are guaranteed to not exhibit problems such as dangling pointers, data races, and unexpected side effects through aliased references. Going beyond memory safety, for instance, to guarantee the absence of assertion failures or functional correctness, requires static program verification. Formal verification of system software is notoriously difficult and requires complex specifications and logics to reason about pointers, aliasing, and side effects on mutable state. This complexity is a major obstacle to a more widespread verification of system software.\n\nIn this paper, we present a novel verification technique that leverages Rust’s type system to greatly simplify the specification and verification of Rust programs. We analyse information from the Rust compiler and synthesise a corresponding core proof for the program in a flavour of separation logic tailored to automation. Crucially, our proofs are constructed and checked automatically; users of our work never work with the underlying formal logic. Users can add specifications at the abstraction level of Rust expressions; we show how to interweave these to extend our core proof to prove modularly whether these specifications are correct. We have implemented our technique for a subset of Rust; our initial evaluation on two thousand functions from widely-used Rust crates demonstrates its effectiveness",

I started Rust when I was still starting my career and finishing up my CS degree and now we have a brand spanking new edition! So much has changed that it’s honestly mind boggling thinking about it. Even at work I gave a history of Rust presentation and it was wild being able to go “back in the day” for something that was just a regular day a few years ago.\n\nNow I find myself thinking about the problems we face as we become an even bigger community. We have a lot of problems. They’re good problems to have, but problems that must be solved eventually. I’m gonna go through all of them, what I see as major pain points/issues we’ve solved up to now, the present problems, and ones on the horizon.

      "content_text": "Recently there has been some discussion about interprocedural borrowing conflicts in rust. This is something I’ve been fighting with a lot, especially while working on my SAT solver varisat. Around the time Niko Matsakis published his blog post about this, I realized that the existing workarounds I’ve been using in varisat have become a maintenance nightmare. Making simple changes to the code required lots of changes in the boilerplate needed to thread various references to the places where they’re needed.\n\nWhile I didn’t think that a new language feature to solve this would be something I’d be willing to wait for, I decided to sit down and figure out how such a language feature would have to look like. I knew that I wanted something that allows for partial borrows across function calls. I also prefer this to work with annotations instead of global inference. While trying to come up with a coherent design that fits neatly into the existing type and trait system, I realized that most of what I wanted can be realized in stable rust today.",

A lot can go wrong, even in this “simple” case. Rocket catches any panics thrown by route handlers, so this is about as robust as a naive equivalent in most other languages. However, Rust at least forces us to be explicit and purposeful about when we want to be sloppy. This is great for a first quick and dirty pass, but we can do much better.",

Followed by a sizeable hiatus (lack of personal time), I came back mid-year 2018. I can say for certain that the focus on usability and ergonomics was successful. Rust is much easier to use now than it was then. Rust format (rustfmt), Rust language server (RLS), text editor support, cargo tooling, compiler messages, and ecosystem crates’ quality and diversity are all amazing. The community is crazy diverse (first language learners, experienced systems people, web-dev people, programming language theory people, etc…).

Even small things were designed with care. And I loved how much Rust cares for code correctness. I prefer to avoid long debug sessions and to use more time in the design and coding phases. So I’ve kept learning and using it ever since. For 2019 and beyond I’d like Rust to keep working on finishing its many unfinished parts.",

However, as others noted, the comparison was fairly limited. It didn't compare Rust's implementation to other implementations, such as glibc's strtod or Go's ParseFloat. The parser I implemented wasn't correct, it led to rounding error for most representations, by using floats for intermediate values. Furthermore, the comparisons used data unlikely to be encountered in real-world datasets, overstating the performance differences by forcing Rust to use slower algorithms. So, naturally, I aimed to address all these concerns. And finally, I forgot to disable CPU scaling, meaning CPU throttling could have led to inconsistent benchmarks.",

But in parallel, John Hudge (Mutabah) developed a Rust compiler, called \"mrustc\", written in C++. mrustc is now good enough to compile Rust 1.19.0.

A lot of this work is spent with larger amounts of data in order to implement the batch layer of the Lambda architecture. Due to this, the largest concern is that the behaviour is consistent across both the batch layer and the realtime layer - naturally you wouldn't want sporadic behaviour across the two. The easiest way to do this is to share code across the layers, to avoid having to keep implementations in sync. We have recently been working with Rust, which has been a little difficult to integrate with Hadoop MapReduce flows due to the fact it's mainly written in Java. It's because of this that I began to work on a small library named Efflux. It's designed as a very small interface to the MapReduce pattern, and implemented in Rust to allow us to share code across the batch layer easily.",

      "content_text": "The Rust project I am working on is a caching layer, currently backed by Redis, and it came to a point where I needed to leverage pipelining. On its own, pipelining is straightforward as the redis crate implements it already. However all notions of a cache in our code are abstracted out behind a trait so we can have alternative implementations, such as an in-memory HashMap-backed implementation.\n\nThe problem arises with representing the pipeline in code. It would force any implementation of our cache to Redis’s notion of a pipeline. Not only would this make it difficult to introspect during testing, but it would also be nonsensical for our HashMap-backed cache. My usual answer to this in languages that support higher-kinded types is to use tagless-final algebras, but Rust’s type system currently doesn’t support higher-kinded types1. Fortunately, there is a pretty good alternative that Rust does support: existential types.",

Because of Rust’s unique features and positioning fully understanding the implementation powering this syntax is very different to understanding other well-known implementations (C# and JavaScript’s being the ones I am familiar with). Instead of thinking of a CPS-like transform where an async function is split into a series of continuations that are chained together via a Future::then method, Rust instead uses a generator/coroutine transform to turn the function into a state machine (C# and probably most JavaScript implementations use a similar transform under the hood, but as far as I’m aware because of the garbage collector these are indistinguishable from the naive CPS transform they are normally described as). For more detail on why Rust is taking this approach you should read eRFC 2033: Experimental Coroutines, that lays out the why’s much better than I could here.\n\nWhat I’m going to try and provide instead, is a look into how this actually works today. What steps the compiler takes to turn an async fn into a normal function returning a state machine that you could write if you wanted to (but you definitely don’t).",

More specifically, that we should let one field rest while we plant another. Rather than focusing on new designs, I suggest we turn our attention outside of RFCs to other areas of Rust.",

As far as communication with JavaScript went, you had to work with raw wasm imports and exports yourself. That meant you could only pass 32- and 64-bit integers and floats back and forth. No Rust structs, JavaScript objects, strings, or slices could be passed back forth. And distributing your library’s .wasm so that other downstream projects could depend on it? Good luck.",

In this post, we’ll see how these facilities can be used to enforce higher-level API constraints in your libraries and software. Once you’re familiar with these techniques, we’ll cover how the same principles apply to advanced memory management and handling of other more abstract resources.",

So every day, we generate about 500 files that are 85MB on disk, and contain about a million streaming JSON objects that take up 1GB when uncompressed. What we want out of those files is incredibly tiny—a few thousand integers, labelled with names and version numbers. Without any real idea of how to get those counts out of S3, I started by writing a proof of concept Ruby script that could parse one of the 500 log files and print out stats from it. Even on my super-fast laptop, my prototype script would take more than 16 hours to parse 24 hours worth of logs.",

I saw it coming up frequently in interesting projects (e.g. ripgrep) and kept hearing good things about it. My hesitation to picking up Rust since its 1.0 release in 2015 came from two fronts. First, I’m completely invested in Go because of InfluxDB. Second, I heard that it was not the easiest thing to learn. While I don’t normally shy away from difficult tasks, I was hesitant because I believe that many developer tools that take off do so because they are easy to use or give developers significant productivity gains. More often than not, I want to invest my time in tools that I think have longevity that will get some critical mass in the market.",

      "content_text": "Although I didn’t start writing this blog when I started writing in Rust, I remember clearly why I started writing in Rust. From what I had been doing in C#, none of it utilized multiple threads. Multi-threaded programming had always been a sore topic for me. Things like thread synchronization and message passing never really made sense to me. I learned Rust mainly due to its promises for ease of programming for multiple threads. Once hearing that things like parts of Firefox were written using it, and the Mozilla themselves were very strongly invested in Rust, I had more reason to start writing in it. I’d assume that if Mozilla were to invest so much in a programming language, it must have some sort of benefits over your usual C and C++ programming languages. Even further than that, I’ve heard of some game studios adopting Rust in their games and I was pretty much hooked at that point.",

(In reality it was largely done in about a week.) I’m quite good at Rust, and I’m okay at C (but rusty; hah!), and I know nothing at all about MP3 decoding. So, it was a fun learning experience. It was very interesting seeing how C and Rust’s different feature set changed how the programs were written. minimp3 turned out to be a good choice for this, since it is standalone, pretty well-written C as far as I can tell, does nothing that needs to be unsafe, and small but not trivial. This article is an attempt to organize my thoughts, notes and observations as I went about the project, in the hopes that it will be useful or at least interesting to someone else.",

      "content_text": "We introduce partially-stateful data-flow, a new streaming data-flow model that supports eviction and reconstruction of data-flow state on demand. By avoiding state explosion and supporting live changes to the data-flow graph, this model makes data-flow viable for building long-lived, low-latency applications, such as web applications. Our implementation, Noria, simplifies the backend infrastructure for read-heavy web applications while improving their performance.\n\nA Noria application supplies a relational schema and a set of parameterized queries, which Noria compiles into a data-flow program that pre-computes results for reads and incrementally applies writes. Noria makes it easy to write high-performance applications without manual performance tuning or complex-to-maintain caching layers. Partial statefulness helps Noria limit its in-memory state without prior data-flow systems’ restriction to windowed state, and helps Noria adapt its data-flow to schema and query changes while on-line. Unlike prior data-flow systems, Noria also shares state and computation across related queries, eliminating duplicate work.\n\nOn a real web application’s queries, our prototype scales to 5× higher load than a hand-optimized MySQL baseline. Noria also outperforms a typical MySQL/memcached stack and the materialized views of a commercial database. It scales to tens of millions of reads and millions of writes per second over multiple servers, outperforming a state-of-the-art streaming data-flow system.",

The C version was compiled with GCC 7.3.0 with -O2 level optimizations; the Rust version was compiled with 1.29.0 with --release. All of the tests were run bound to a processor set containing a single core; all were bound to one logical CPU within that core, with the other logical CPU forced to be idle. cpustat was used to gather CPU performance counter data, with one number denoting one run with pic0 programmed to that CPU performance counter. The input file (~30MB compressed) contains 3.5M state changes, and in the default config will generate a ~6MB SVG. ",

For the unfamiliar, pass-by-value means that when passing an argument to a function it gets copied into the new function so that the value in the calling function and the value in the called function are two separate values. Changes to one will not in turn result in the same change to the other. Pass-by-reference, on the other hand, means that when passing an argument to a function, it doesn’t copy the value but rather the argument is merely a transparent reference to the original value. This means changes to the value in the called function change the value in the calling function since they are the same value.",

Almost all modern languages, both statically and dynamically typed, will fail at runtime in these situations.",

So, typical tech stacks for backend development can’t be used, never mind anything that uses browser technologies. Unsurprisingly, almost all embedded software is written in C++, and, in fact, that is also what I used recently for a personal project with a micro-controller.\n\nLooking through the remaining choices, I went past Golang, which uses garbage collection, and set my eyes on Rust. In this post I’ll describe my first impressions, some of the frustrating moments, but also the extremely impressive performance on a larger piece of code.",

Second, Lua functions are dynamically allocated (‘boxed’.) Rust does not allocate silently because it prefers to be explicit and is a system language designed for maximally efficient code. Third, closures share references with their environment. In the case of Lua, the garbage collector ensures that these references will live long enough. With Rust, the borrow checker needs to be able to track the lifetimes of these references.",

The points demonstrate real difficulties with attempting to use a general framework for these problems and to me serves perfectly as a “the ball’s in your court now” to anyone claiming Rust is ignoring theory and coming up with unnecessary solutions to solved problems: if you think Rust could use monadic abstractions, you have to be able to address these counterarguments.",

This came up often enough in recent discussions that I think it is worth writing it down properly once, so I can just link here in the future.",

Today, the pin feature adds the PinMut and PinBox types, but in theory there ought to be a “pinned” version of every pointer in the standard library: PinRc and PinArc and so on. This is a very unfortunate consequence, but so far we have not found a good way to make pinning work compositionally - to have a single adapter that could be combined with any pointer.\n\nLast night, a bit of inspiration struck me, and I realized that it is possible to make a compositional Pin type. This isn’t a fundamental change to the pinning model, just an API refactoring, but I’ve put a blocking concern on the proposal to stabilize Pin so that we can consider this possibility.",

However, the log create is just a facade, and by default the messages do not get emitted anywhere. The calling code has to set up a logger. Crates like env_logger let one set up a logger, during program initialization, that gets configured through an environment variable. This is a problem for librsvg: we are not the program's initialization! Librsvg is a library; it doesn't have a main() function. And since most of the calling code is not Rust, we can't assume that they can call code that can initialize the logging framework.",

An obvious example is 3d graphics rendering. Even a small scene like the ones I've been creating involve computing millions of vector dot product calculations per second.

While Rust is definitely better teacher (I’m looking at you, C++ error message!) and has many more „safety covers“ over the dangerous moving parts inside the engine, the design of the engine is more of an evolution from C++ than a completely new thing.\n\nBut I’ve noticed one rather subtle difference in the philosophy of the languages I’d like to describe here.

This will all be written from a C++ programmers standpoint that was thought writing Object Oriented code. I encourage you the reader to think critically and correct where necessary.\n\nOn to the actual first post! After reading “the Rust Programming Language” I wanted to get my hands dirty and actually write some code. I like graphical applications and using low level graphics API’s so I decided to implement a cellular automation in rust. But just implementing cellular automation isn’t very exciting, is it? What if we could do this on the GPU…And off I went on my journey to create Conway’s game of life in rust.",

As I see it, there is no truer answer. The type system can be a seductive beast, often promising correctness and performance at the low-low, one-time cost of your soul.

As such, many of the edge cases are likely to fall away as we develop after stabilization and come up with standard methods to work with the new feature.\n\nThe primary work to migrate is essentially just deleting ~all lifetime headers (<'a, 'b, 'c>) across impls and functions. More intensive migration would involve replacing untied/single-use lifetimes with '_ in all cases. This is quite hard to do from a person perspective (though compiler can likely do so fairly easily).",

So while are waiting, we can try tackling the streaming iterator problem without GATs. In this post we explore three possible workarounds for situations where an associated type depends on the lifetime of a &self receiver.",

Until now, these parallel formulas don’t seem to have been implemented in software. But a closer look reveals that slightly modifying the formulas allows the expensive instructions to be executed in uniform, making a vectorized SIMD implementation possible.\n\nI implemented this strategy in Rust, targeting 256-bit wide AVX2 operations. The resulting implementation performs double-base scalar multiplication faster than other Ed25519 implementations I tested, and is even faster than FourQ without endomorphisms",

More importantly, I wanted there to be a reason for making a new framework; it couldn’t just be yet another framework with the only difference being I’ve written it. Instead, the way this framework is used is quite different than many that exist. In doing so, it expresses a strong opinion, which might not match your previous experiences, but I believe it manages to do something really special.\n\nI’m super excited to reveal warp, a joint project with @carllerche.",

As a recap, Monotron currently generates an 800 x 600 VGA signal at 60 Hz (with a pixel clock of 40 MHz). It does this using three synchronised SPI peripherals, a timer generating the horizontal-sync pulse and a GPIO pin for the vertical-sync. With the CPU running at a clock speed of 80 MHz, the SPI peripherals are clocked at 20 MHz producing 400 horizontal pixels per line. This is half the nominal 800 pixels, but we needed to sacrifice resolution to double the amount of CPU time we have to 4 clocks per pixel (i.e. 32 clocks per 8-bit character column).",

Both parts of this statement are false, at least in languages with unsafe features like Rust or C: Pointers are neither simple nor (just) integers.\n\nI also want to define a piece of the memory model that has to be fixed before we can even talk about some of the more complex parts: Just what is the data that is stored in memory? It is organized in bytes, the minimal addressable unit and the smallest piece that can be accessed (at least on most platforms), but what are the possible values of a byte? Again, it turns out “it’s just an 8-bit integer” does not actually work as the answer.\n\nI hope that by the end of this post, you will agree with me on both of these statements. :)",

Since then, there have been various discussions about which operations should be allowed during CTFE, which checks the compiler should do, how this all relates to promotion and which kinds of guarantees we should be able to expect around CTFE. This post is my take on those topics, and it should not be surprising that I am going to take a very type-system centric view. Expect something like a structured brain dump, so there are some unanswered questions towards the end as well.",

Moreover, both languages are supposed to focus on systems software. But they are vastly different, and even as they both target systems software, they target different kinds of such software.",

      "content_text": "Poor usability of cryptographic APIs is a severe source of vulnerabilities. Aim: We wanted to find out what kind of cryptographic libraries are present in Rust and how usable they are. Method: We explored Rust's cryptographic libraries through a systematic search, conducted an exploratory study on the major libraries and a controlled experiment on two of these libraries with 28 student participants. Results: Only half of the major libraries explicitly focus on usability and misuse resistance, which is reflected in their current APIs. We found that participants were more successful using rust-crypto which we considered less usable than ring before the experiment. Conclusion: We discuss API design insights and make recommendations for the design of crypto libraries in Rust regarding the detail and structure of the documentation, higher-level APIs as wrappers for the existing low-level libraries, and selected, good-quality example code to improve the emerging cryptographic libraries of Rust.",

In the particular case of a multi-rotor drone, the flight controller is responsible for converting the UP command from the transmitter into specific outputs for each of the motors. Maintaining the stability of a drone involves carefully adjusting the output of each motor thousands of times per second based on feedback from on-board sensors.\n\nThere are several great C-based open source drone flight controller firmware projects, but as far as I can see there are none written in Rust. The good news is that most drone flight controllers are based on STM32 MCUs, which Rust has strong support for. Robust flight controller firmware is quite complex, and there are a number of challenges to be solved before even getting the rotors spinning. The first of those challenges is building a Rust project for a particular flight controller board, and flashing the board with the compiled code. A single blinking LED is our goal for today.",

But those utilities are simple and have no big complications under the hood, so they are perfect candidates for rewriting in Rust for the sake of writing in Rust (I’m learning it!). I decide to combine them into a single utility: devtop, which I want to develop properly, according to Rust conventions, and through all aspects of packaging.",

Do not throw away your existing code base, because Rust plays well with others. Regardless of whether you are a Rust or Web developer, your natural workflow shouldn’t change because Rust compiled to wasm integrates seamlessly into your preferred tools.\n\nThis blog post will expand on these aspirations and describe where we stand in relation to them right now.

This post aims to serve as a quick tutorial showing how to write extensions in Rust, talking about why you might want to use something more powerful than just exposing a C library called using CFFI, and how PyO3 lets you write Python aware extensions in Rust.

      "content_text": "In my last post on optimising my Rust path tracer with SIMD I had got withing 10% of my performance target, that is Aras’s C++ SSE4.1 path tracer. From profiling I had determined that the main differences were MSVC using SSE versions of sinf and cosf and differences between Rayon and enkiTS thread pools. The first thing I tried was implement an SSE2 version of sin_cos based off of Julien Pommier’s code that I found via a bit of googling. This was enough to get my SSE4.1 implementation to match the performance of Aras’s SSE4.1 code. I had a slight advantage in that I just call sin_cos as a single function versus separate sin and cos functions, but meh, I’m calling my performance target reached.\n\nThe other part of this post is about Rust’s runtime and compile time CPU feature detection and some wrong turns I took along the way.",

But before we begin, a little warning: the examples below are, by no means, idiomatic Rust—I just hope they are simple enough to illustrate what I want to show.",

For that reason, you see a great deal of encouragement nowadays to move to newer languages - they're designed with contemporary platforms in mind, rather than working within the limitations of platforms like the PDP-11. Among said \"new languages\" are Zig, Myrddin, Go, Nim, D, Rust.. even languages like Java and Elixir that run on a virtual machine are occasionally suggested as alternatives to the AOT-compiled C and C++.\n\nI have plans to look into the characteristics that distinguish each and every one of these new programming languages, learning them and documenting my first impressions in the form of blog posts.

To get a better comparison I copied his scene and also added his light sampling approach which he talks about here. I also implemented a live render loop mimicking his.",

Only 20% is the actual instrumentation of application code.\n\nSo, starting with Python, our goal became \"how do we prevent more duplication\". In order to do that, we decided to split the agent into two components. A language agent and a core agent. The language agent is the Python component, and the core agent is a standalone executable that contains most of the shared logic.",

One of my pet peeves when reviewing C++ code is to ask authors to sprinkle the const qualifier everywhere: if something ain’t mutated, say so explicitly. This includes marking local variables, function arguments, function return values, class attributes, etc.",

Unfortunately, many known schemes that enable search queries on encrypted data achieve efficiency at the expense of security, as they reveal access patterns to the encrypted data.  In this paper we present Oblix, a search index for encrypted data that is oblivious (provably hides access patterns), is dynamic (supports inserts and deletes), and has good efficiency.  Oblix relies on a combination of novel oblivious-access tech- niques and recent hardware enclave platforms (e.g., Intel SGX).  In particular, a key technical contribution is the design and implementation of doubly-oblivious data structures, in which the client’s accesses to its internal memory are oblivious, in addition to accesses to its external memory at the server. These algorithms are motivated by hardware enclaves like SGX, which leak access patterns to both internal and external memory.  We demonstrate the usefulness of Oblix in several applications: private contact discovery for Signal, private retrieval of public keys for Key Transparency, and searchable encryption that hides access patterns and result sizes.",

I didn’t understand how stability was such an important feature. I was familiar with needing new versions of the nightly compiler to stay current with clippy and rustfmt, but it was a blindspot when it came to dependencies.",

All languages have their niches, and Rust is no different.\n\nRust is a statically typed compiled language that fills the roles that most users use C or C++ for. Unlike C or C++, though, Rust also encroaches on territory that C# and the Java™ language have dominated for much of this century: Rust is a language that is memory safe and operating system agnostic, meaning that it can run on any computer. Essentially, you get all the speed and low-level benefits of a systems language without the pesky garbage collection of those latter languages I mentioned. Excited? Yeah, me, too. Welcome to Rust! ",

Since Option knows that Box is non-nullable, it should compile down to a raw pointer. Quickly inspecting the Rust and C++ versions would not let me find where the performance difference came from.",

A core language is an intermediate representation that is a subset of the surface language.\n\nWhile I optimised that interpreter quite a bit, I noticed that the CTree (Stratego Core Abstract Syntax Tree) that the compiler spit out for me to interpret was very unoptimised. Therefore one the plans I described at the end of the blog post was a little tool for Copy Propagation on CTree files. This post is about that tool, and the optimisations in the interpreter that made it obsolete again.",

      "content_text": "One of Rust’s design goals is to be fast. That actually needs two distinct things from the language. First, is it shouldn’t introduce too much (preferably zero) overhead for its abstractions and be fast out of the box. Many people coming from the high level languages (python, javascript, …) find this to be the case ‒ just type the program, compile it (with --release) and it’s reasonable fast. The other, no less important, is allowing the programmer to tweak some knobs when trying to squeeze a bit more speed out of the program.\n\nI’ve decided to test the second a bit and see how far I could go. I’ve chosen matrix multiplication as a case study, for several reasons. I’ve played with it before (in my master’s thesis), it’s relatively simple and the effects of optimizing it can be great. For simplicity, I’ve decided to multiply only square matrices with power-of-two sizes, but these restrictions can be lifted in a real implementation without significantly loosing performance ‒ only the code gets somewhat more complex and hairy.",

      "content_text": "Rust is a new and promising high-level system programming language. It provides both memory safety and thread safety through its novel mechanisms such as ownership, moves and borrows. Ownership system ensures that at any point there is only one owner of any given resource. The ownership of a resource can be moved or borrowed according to the lifetimes. The ownership system establishes a clear lifetime for each value and hence does not necessarily need garbage collection. These novel features bring Rust high performance, fine low-level control of C and C++, and unnecessity in garbage collection, which differ Rust from other existing prevalent languages. For formal analysis of Rust programs and helping programmers learn its new mechanisms and features, a formal semantics of Rust is desired and useful as a fundament for developing related tools. In this paper, we present a formal executable operational semantics of a realistic subset of Rust, called KRust. The semantics is defined in K, a rewriting-based executable semantic framework for programming languages. The executable semantics yields automatically a formal interpreter and verification tools for Rust programs. KRust has been thoroughly validated by testing with hundreds of tests, including the official Rust test suite.",

Servo is comparable to WebKit, an open source browser engine that is the foundation of Apple’s Safari browser. (Other browser engines include Blink, EdgeHTML, and Gecko.) The difference is that Servo is written in the Rust programming language, bringing lightning-fast performance and memory safety to browser internals. Rust code can drastically cut down the number of critical bugs that affect browser engines. Servo uses a modular architecture and currently runs on Linux, macOS, Windows, and Android operating systems.",

However, the performance has a long way to go (it is currently slower than existing analysis). That said, I haven’t even begun to optimize yet, and I know I am doing some naive and inefficient things that can definitely be done better; so I am still optimistic we’ll be able to make big strides there.",

It also exposes all the knobs required for implementing custom rules, enabling a project to make additional guarantees and enforce opinions on best practice. Embedded standards are very opinionated about software practices—like using floating point values as loop counters or the number of possible exit points of a function—and Rust’s defaults don’t prevent every runtime panic (for example, recursion that goes too deep and overflows the stack).\n\nFor PolySync, a runtime panic means the potential for an unsafe situation on the road, and with that in mind, we’ve explored ways to restrict that potential. Of course, we aren’t the only ones thinking about ways to improve the quality of code at compile time by enforcing the right rules for the job. Active projects like rust-clippy are working to do that too by providing lints to supplement the rustc defaults.\n\nIn this post we’ll explore how to enforce a rule by prohibiting a practice we’ve formed an opinion about, the indexing of a vector or an array.",

Despite the severity of these risks, software continues to be written for safety-critical applications in languages that permit common classes of failures, such as undefined behavior, state corruption, and unexpected termination. One such language is C. Language standards that define allowable subsets (e.g. MISRA) and static analysis tools are often used in an attempt to ameliorate these failures by detecting them in the program code before they result in a critical issue at runtime. These traditional methods are ultimately insufficient when it comes to providing ahead-of-time assurances about safe runtime behavior for safety-critical applications. Alternative approaches must be considered.",

Their use-case was basically to receive an as-high-as-possible number of audio RTP streams over UDP, transcode them, and then send them out via UDP again. Due to how GStreamer usually works, they were running into some performance issues.\n\nThis blog post will describe the first set of improvements that were implemented for this use-case, together with a minimal benchmark and the results. My colleague Mathieu will follow up with one or two other blog posts with the other improvements and a more full-featured benchmark.\n\nThe short version is that CPU usage decreased by about 65-75%, i.e. allowing 3-4x more streams with the same CPU usage. Also parallelization works better and usage of different CPU cores is more controllable, allowing for better scalability. And a fixed, but configurable number of threads is used, which is independent of the number of streams.",

This is a nice metaphor because it explains a lot: Rust may feel more cumbersome, because it won’t let you cut corners. On the other hand, once it compiles, many classes of errors will already have been taken care of, so your code will usually work as expected (or if you’re new to Rust, unexpectedly well).",

That very same principle, event-driven I/O, is the same reason I chose Node.js for most of the APIs I’ve developed since 2011. Even if practices change, we retain successful engineering models.\n\nBeginning late last year, as I sketched our founding mission and initial product offerings, I also decided to select a new primary language that could handle most of our primary development tasks.

Knowing that certain things just cannot be done helps putting your mind back back on the right track.\n\nSo here are things not to do in Rust and what to do instead which I think should be better known.",

One is to restrict the programming language and disallow pointers. But, this forces most programs to make unnecessary copies of data. Another strategy, called garbage collection, embeds a garbage collector with every program. The garbage collector periodically looks for objects in memory that cannot be accessed from the program and reclaims this memory. The drawbacks of this are the overhead of garbage collection and that deallocation of memory is no longer under the control of the programmer.",

No matter how many tests you write, or how well-disciplined your team, any new development is sure to introduce a stream of bugs that will need to be shored up over the course of months or years.\n\nCentral to the problem are the edges. People will reliably do a good job of building and testing the happy paths, but as humans we’re terrible at considering the edge conditions, and it’s those edges and corners that cause trouble over the years that a program is in service.",

Furthermore, there isn’t just one RAM, but each memory location can live in different caches at each time and some of them are private to each CPU.

As a frontend-by-day developer I don't come face-to-face with the 'Double free' and 'Use after free' problems all that often. Actually, it could be easily argued that my backend-brethren don't really either or, for that matter, anyone who's typically dealing with a garbage collected language. I'm looking over at you JS, Java, and Ruby devs. I'd bet most neckbea.. *cough, excuse me, C developers are comfortable with these issues but alas, I am not. As such, lifetimes were kinda difficult to wrap my head around but I think I get them a little better now so let me try to explain.",

I’ve been a reasonably active member of the C++ community for quite a while now, attending and contributing talks to conferences, following the development and evangelism of the language’s more modern features and of course writing lots of it. C++ is a language that gives its users very fine-grained control over all aspects of the program they are writing, at the cost of a steep learning curve and a large body of knowledge required to write effective C++. However, C++ is also a very old language, conceived by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1985, and thus caries a lot of technical debt even into modern standards.",

For example in a web page’s content tree, from any DOM node, one can easily access (if any) its first and last child, previous and next sibling, (so children of a node form a doubly-linked list) and parent.

One example of this is the borrow checker which prevents data races, iterator invalidation, pointer invalidation and other issues at compile time. Other memory problems like buffer overflows can’t be prevented at compile time. In those cases the compiler inserts runtime checks, bounds checks in this case, to enforce memory safety at runtime. What about stack overflows? For quite a long time Rust didn’t have stack overflow checking but that wasn’t much of a problem on tier 1 platforms since these platforms have an OS and a MMU (Memory Management Unit) that prevents stack overflows from wreaking havoc.",

As I said back then: I held myself to the same constraints as the original contest; no external packages is a bit painful in Rust, but it’s not too bad. Mostly it would let me eliminate boilerplate while also improving correctness, and making the code a bit shorter. So, that got me thinking: What would this look like if I could use external packages? I took about an hour, and knocked it out. I have two versions to show you today, one where I pay no attention to allocations, and one where it’s zero-allocation.",

There’ll be some more changes, though, at least because Tokio just released a new version (and Futures plan to do so soon), so Corona will have to adapt.",

My wants haven’t changed much over the last year or so: give me non-embarassing compilation speed! 😁\n\nBefore getting started, I’m very appreciative of the hard work put into the overall Rust community and ecosystem, including the behind-the-scenes work. It’s difficult to understate just how much time and energy people volunteer in pursuit of a better, Rust-ier world.",
