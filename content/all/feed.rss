My path to Rust certainly is not typical (I studied HR Management in undergrad…).

The journey really started for me back in middle/high school as I was very interested in video games, computers, and how things worked. So with a few friends started a computer repair "business" that serviced the local (Western Pennsylvania) area. By the time my sophomore year of highschool rolled around we had lined up a few of the parents who owned local businesses/churches and were doing some pretty serious consulting/maintenance for our ages (also installing Halo and Half-life 2: Deathmatch on the school's servers...).]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">469533e2-7193-41b3-a754-adb5281e276f</guid><pubDate>Thu, 31 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Ricky Hosfelt</dc:creator></item><item><title>Rust review: The borrow checker</title><link>http://julio.meroh.net/2018/06/rust-review-borrow-checker.html</link><description><![CDATA[Aaaah, the borrow checker: the dreaded enemy lurking within the Rust compiler, ready to make its move to bring pain to your life by preventing your code from compiling.

Does the original remain the same, or does it change too?

If you think of copying as creating a completely new object, of course you expect that any change to the new copy does not affect the original object. But if you think of copying as creating a new name for the same, single object, then you expect that any change to the object through the new name appears also when you access the same object through the old name.

Let's see how is the behavior of Python, Javascript, Java, C++, and Rust regarding the assignment operator ("=") between collection variables.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">80930880-f4a9-4485-b372-648928490dca</guid><pubDate>Fri,  1 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Carlo Milanesi</dc:creator></item><item><title>Fear not the Rust Borrow Checker</title><link>http://www.squidarth.com/rc/rust/2018/05/31/rust-borrowing-and-ownership.html</link><description><![CDATA[I spent pretty much the whole day banging my head against the wall trying to figure out how ownership and borrowing work in Rust, and finally have a grasp on what’s going on.

To create a HTTP request a full URL is needed with a scheme (http/https), authority (example.org) and a path (/search?q=rust) but http does enforce this and allows you to only state the path.

Our Ruby and Elixir agents had duplicated much of their code between them, and we didn't want to add a third copy of the agent-plumbing code. The overlapping code included things like JSON payload format, SQL statement parsing, temporary data storage and compaction, and a number of internal business logic components.

This plumbing code is about 80% of the agent code! Only 20% is the actual instrumentation of application code.

So, starting with Python, our goal became "how do we prevent more duplication". In order to do that, we decided to split the agent into two components. A language agent and a core agent. The language agent is the Python component, and the core agent is a standalone executable that contains most of the shared logic.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">12f71ab8-809a-45a6-8e95-fd98a92e7f60</guid><pubDate>Thu,  5 Apr 2018 07:46:00 -0400</pubDate><dc:creator>Chris</dc:creator></item><item><title>Mix Rust Code (WebAssembly) with Vue Component</title><link>https://busy.org/@drsensor/mix-rust-code-webassembly-with-vue-component-basic</link><description><![CDATA[In this tutorials, we will try mixing Rust code with Javascript by compiling Rust code as .wasm then use it in Vue Component.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">342c3a2c-88a7-4e26-a6ea-97c3257daf2d</guid><pubDate>Thu, 24 May 2018 19:01:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>drsensor</dc:creator></item><item><title>Learning Rust — Conspiracies, Databases, and Diesel.rs</title><link>https://medium.com/@rippinrobr_66849/2-conspiracies-databases-and-diesel-rs-ac1d8d3499b3</link><description><![CDATA[This post is the second in a series of posts where I share my experience learning Rust.

To understand why this is important, let&rsquo;s cover some context first.

Unfortunately, many known schemes that enable search queries on encrypted data achieve efficiency at the expense of security, as they reveal access patterns to the encrypted data.  In this paper we present Oblix, a search index for encrypted data that is oblivious (provably hides access patterns), is dynamic (supports inserts and deletes), and has good efficiency.  Oblix relies on a combination of novel oblivious-access tech- niques and recent hardware enclave platforms (e.g., Intel SGX).  In particular, a key technical contribution is the design and implementation of doubly-oblivious data structures, in which the client’s accesses to its internal memory are oblivious, in addition to accesses to its external memory at the server. These algorithms are motivated by hardware enclaves like SGX, which leak access patterns to both internal and external memory.  We demonstrate the usefulness of Oblix in several applications: private contact discovery for Signal, private retrieval of public keys for Key Transparency, and searchable encryption that hides access patterns and result sizes.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">e2724828-a6e9-4383-9614-bea31e743784</guid><pubDate>Mon, 21 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Pratyush Mishra, Rishabh Poddar, Jerry Chen, Alessandro Chiesa, Raluca Ada Popa</dc:creator></item><item><title>Rust review: Introduction</title><link>http://julio.meroh.net/2018/05/rust-review-introduction.html</link><description><![CDATA[I had been meaning to learn Rust since I first toyed with Go a couple of years ago.

It amounts to a tight set of rules about who owns a value in a program, how that value can be aliased and mutated, and when that value is dropped. It prevents shared mutable state, which is the root cause of major bugs in software written without the same guarantees.

When Foo::take returns, because of self going out of scope, it must call its Drop::drop implementation. If you have moved out of it – both a: A and b: B fields, the Drop::drop implementation is now a complete UB. So Rust is right here and doesn’t allow you to do this.

But imagine that we have to do this. For insance, we need to hand over both the scarce resources a and b to another struct (in our case, a (A, B), but you could easily imagine a better type for this).

There’s a way to, still, implement Foo::take with Foo implementing Drop.

It's a valid question. Does your code need to be as fast as possible? Will it be running on the Web? Will the code be on the back end or the front? All languages have their niches, and Rust is no different.

Rust is a statically typed compiled language that fills the roles that most users use C or C++ for. Unlike C or C++, though, Rust also encroaches on territory that C# and the Java™ language have dominated for much of this century: Rust is a language that is memory safe and operating system agnostic, meaning that it can run on any computer. Essentially, you get all the speed and low-level benefits of a systems language without the pesky garbage collection of those latter languages I mentioned. Excited? Yeah, me, too.

While I optimised that interpreter quite a bit, I noticed that the CTree (Stratego Core Abstract Syntax Tree) that the compiler spit out for me to interpret was very unoptimised.

That actually needs two distinct things from the language. First, is it shouldn’t introduce too much (preferably zero) overhead for its abstractions and be fast out of the box. Many people coming from the high level languages (python, javascript, …) find this to be the case ‒ just type the program, compile it (with --release) and it’s reasonable fast. The other, no less important, is allowing the programmer to tweak some knobs when trying to squeeze a bit more speed out of the program.

I’ve decided to test the second a bit and see how far I could go. I’ve chosen matrix multiplication as a case study, for several reasons. I’ve played with it before (in my master’s thesis), it’s relatively simple and the effects of optimizing it can be great. For simplicity, I’ve decided to multiply only square matrices with power-of-two sizes, but these restrictions can be lifted in a real implementation without significantly loosing performance ‒ only the code gets somewhat more complex and hairy.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">d18e865c-71c2-4c7e-85ff-7d84e1999055</guid><pubDate>Sat, 12 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Michal &apos;vorner&apos; Vaner</dc:creator></item><item><title>Bulletproof Multi-Party Computation in Rust with Session Types</title><link>https://blog.chain.com/bulletproof-multi-party-computation-in-rust-with-session-types-b3da6e928d5d</link><description><![CDATA[In Rust, objects are either owned or borrowed. While there can be multiple borrows of the same object, each object has a unique owner. When objects are passed by value, ownership is transferred to the new scope, and the old scope can no longer access it.

In the party and dealer types, such methods consume the previous state and return the next state in the protocol.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">0308ada3-604c-4240-8e94-2f9d23bc2934</guid><pubDate>Fri, 11 May 2018 22:25:19 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Cathie Yun</dc:creator></item><item><title>On the origin of rustaceans</title><link>https://quietmisdreavus.net/code/2018/05/11/on-the-origin-of-rustaceans/</link><description><![CDATA[The “Increasing Rust’s Reach” projects are kicking off!

It provides both memory safety and thread safety through its novel mechanisms such as ownership, moves and borrows. Ownership system ensures that at any point there is only one owner of any given resource. The ownership of a resource can be moved or borrowed according to the lifetimes. The ownership system establishes a clear lifetime for each value and hence does not necessarily need garbage collection. These novel features bring Rust high performance, fine low-level control of C and C++, and unnecessity in garbage collection, which differ Rust from other existing prevalent languages. For formal analysis of Rust programs and helping programmers learn its new mechanisms and features, a formal semantics of Rust is desired and useful as a fundament for developing related tools. In this paper, we present a formal executable operational semantics of a realistic subset of Rust, called KRust. The semantics is defined in K, a rewriting-based executable semantic framework for programming languages. The executable semantics yields automatically a formal interpreter and verification tools for Rust programs. KRust has been thoroughly validated by testing with hundreds of tests, including the official Rust test suite.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">0c0d7114-9e80-4e4f-868d-51de6778bed1</guid><pubDate>Sat, 28 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Feng Wang, Fu Song, Min Zhang, Xiaoran Zhu, Jun Zhang</dc:creator></item><item><title>Servo engines written in Rust deliver memory safety and multithreading</title><link>https://research.mozilla.org/servo-engines/</link><description><![CDATA[In 2012, Mozilla started the Servo project, a community effort to create new open source browser components that can take advantage of multicore hardware to improve speed, stability and responsiveness.

It also exposes all the knobs required for implementing custom rules, enabling a project to make additional guarantees and enforce opinions on best practice. Embedded standards are very opinionated about software practices—like using floating point values as loop counters or the number of possible exit points of a function—and Rust’s defaults don’t prevent every runtime panic (for example, recursion that goes too deep and overflows the stack).

For PolySync, a runtime panic means the potential for an unsafe situation on the road, and with that in mind, we’ve explored ways to restrict that potential. Of course, we aren’t the only ones thinking about ways to improve the quality of code at compile time by enforcing the right rules for the job. Active projects like rust-clippy are working to do that too by providing lints to supplement the rustc defaults.

In this post we’ll explore how to enforce a rule by prohibiting a practice we’ve formed an opinion about, the indexing of a vector or an array.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">4096f192-ba2d-4a25-b1be-f3e4b0b40b51</guid><pubDate>Sat, 21 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Shea Newton</dc:creator></item><item><title>Why Rust&apos;s error handling is awesome</title><link>http://rantsideasstuff.com/posts/2018/04/20-rust-error-handling-awesome/</link><description><![CDATA[This post is about the process of transforming something you would write as a one-off script in Python (or any other scripting language) into a library including error handling.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">ba2b10d2-16a7-4036-8e8f-1fe0d113b0ac</guid><pubDate>Fri, 20 Apr 2018 10:00:00 +0200</pubDate><dc:creator>Zoran Zaric</dc:creator></item><item><title>Pijul 0.10</title><link>https://pijul.org/posts/2018-04-21-pijul-0.10/</link><description><![CDATA[I’m pleased to announce the new release of Pijul, version 0.10.

Despite the severity of these risks, software continues to be written for safety-critical applications in languages that permit common classes of failures, such as undefined behavior, state corruption, and unexpected termination. One such language is C. Language standards that define allowable subsets (e.g. MISRA) and static analysis tools are often used in an attempt to ameliorate these failures by detecting them in the program code before they result in a critical issue at runtime. These traditional methods are ultimately insufficient when it comes to providing ahead-of-time assurances about safe runtime behavior for safety-critical applications. Alternative approaches must be considered.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">30fe522c-e827-436a-bd52-40314d80e95b</guid><pubDate>Wed, 11 Apr 2018 08:54:41 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Shea Newton, Nathan Aschbache</dc:creator></item><item><title>Why would I use divergent functions?</title><link>https://medium.com/@yangnana11/rust-why-would-i-use-divergent-functions-d9dec59071bc</link><description><![CDATA[Rust has some special syntax for ‘diverging functions’, which are functions that do not return.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">2238849b-fcc8-4bd4-9828-66637c22f9af</guid><pubDate>Wed, 11 Apr 2018 08:54:41 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Yang Nana</dc:creator></item><item><title>Writing An NES Emulator with Rust and WebAssembly</title><link>https://medium.com/@bokuweb17/writing-an-nes-emulator-with-rust-and-webassembly-d64de101c49d</link><description><![CDATA[I wrote the NES emulator with Rust and WebAssembly to learn Rust.

This post is about another application of pinned references—another API whose safety relies on the pinning guarantees: Intrusive collections.

This significantly reduces the attack surfaces, which facilitates auditing and restricting the remaining attack surfaces. MesaLink is cross-platform and provides OpenSSL-compatible APIs.

With the growth of the ecosystem, MesaLink would also be adopted in the server environment in the future.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">afc97289-36f8-4acb-ab80-28e7770ea126</guid><pubDate>Fri,  6 Apr 2018 07:00:00 +1000</pubDate><dc:creator>MesaLock Linux</dc:creator></item><item><title>Improving GStreamer performance with tokio</title><link>https://coaxion.net/blog/2018/04/improving-gstreamer-performance-on-a-high-number-of-network-streams-by-sharing-threads-between-elements-with-rusts-tokio-crate/</link><description><![CDATA[For one of our customers at Centricular we were working on a quite interesting project. Their use-case was basically to receive an as-high-as-possible number of audio RTP streams over UDP, transcode them, and then send them out via UDP again. Due to how GStreamer usually works, they were running into some performance issues.

This blog post will describe the first set of improvements that were implemented for this use-case, together with a minimal benchmark and the results. My colleague Mathieu will follow up with one or two other blog posts with the other improvements and a more full-featured benchmark.

The short version is that CPU usage decreased by about 65-75%, i.e. allowing 3-4x more streams with the same CPU usage. Also parallelization works better and usage of different CPU cores is more controllable, allowing for better scalability. And a fixed, but configurable number of threads is used, which is independent of the number of streams.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">98f65a4a-8501-45e4-bda8-48d5d01306ba</guid><pubDate>Thu,  5 Apr 2018 15:21:06 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Sebastian Dröge</dc:creator></item><item><title>HTTP upgrades with hyper</title><link>http://seanmonstar.com/post/172531530657/http-upgrades-with-hyper</link><description><![CDATA[The newest release of hyper includes some lower-level connection APIs for both the server and client.

That very same principle, event-driven I/O, is the same reason I chose Node.js for most of the APIs I’ve developed since 2011. Even if practices change, we retain successful engineering models.

However talking to people new to Rust (and even brainstorming APIs with coworkers) it's hard to get rid of the feeling that Rust can be a mind bending adventure and that the best way to have a stress free experience is knowing upfront what you cannot (or should not attempt to) do.

There are different ways to guarantee memory safety for all programs. One is to restrict the programming language and disallow pointers. But, this forces most programs to make unnecessary copies of data. Another strategy, called garbage collection, embeds a garbage collector with every program. The garbage collector periodically looks for objects in memory that cannot be accessed from the program and reclaims this memory. The drawbacks of this are the overhead of garbage collection and that deallocation of memory is no longer under the control of the programmer.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">dc304d16-2ec3-45b1-833b-a9536c1a7d95</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:52:22 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Balagopal Komarath</dc:creator></item><item><title>Speeding Up &apos;dwarfdump&apos; With Rust</title><link>https://robert.ocallahan.org/2018/03/speeding-up-dwarfdump-with-rust.html</link><description><![CDATA[Writing a debugger for C++ on Linux, you spend a lot of time examining pretty-printed DWARF debug information using tools like readelf, objdump or dwarfdump.

They’re fast and fun to work in at small scale, but when you have a project that gets big, their attractive veneer quickly washes away. A big Ruby or JavaScript (just to name a few) program in production is a never ending game of whack-a-mock – you fix one problem only to find a new one somewhere else. No matter how many tests you write, or how well-disciplined your team, any new development is sure to introduce a stream of bugs that will need to be shored up over the course of months or years.

Central to the problem are the edges. People will reliably do a good job of building and testing the happy paths, but as humans we’re terrible at considering the edge conditions, and it’s those edges and corners that cause trouble over the years that a program is in service.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">9f012379-d71a-4c45-b9db-12c4871070e7</guid><pubDate>Tue, 27 Mar 2018 14:45:57 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Brandur Leach</dc:creator></item><item><title>Designing a fast CLI join tool with rust</title><link>https://milancio42.github.io/blog/2018-03-22-rjoin/</link><description><![CDATA[(or how rust helped me to match the speed of GNU join written by Mike Haertel)]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">cfc59513-ea0b-4d61-ac46-d7ea2e5bba8b</guid><pubDate>Thu, 22 Mar 2018 09:27:20 +0100</pubDate><dc:creator>Milan Opath</dc:creator></item><item><title>xray Update for March 26, 2018</title><link>https://github.com/atom/xray/blob/master/docs/updates/2018_03_26.md</link><description><![CDATA[Xray - An experimental next-generation Electron-based text editor.

Not only many things can happen all at once, but what you wrote in the code isn’t exactly what happens in the CPU. To gain some more performance, the compiler cheats if it thinks nobody is watching. It can reorder instructions or throw some of them out if they look useless. The same happens in the hardware. Furthermore, there isn’t just one RAM, but each memory location can live in different caches at each time and some of them are private to each CPU. It would not make do to publish all the local changes to one’s cache right away.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">eef1f270-fb75-475a-b10c-8e3813990362</guid><pubDate>Sun, 25 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Michal &apos;vorner&apos; Vaner</dc:creator></item><item><title>Refactoring some repetitive code to a Rust macro</title><link>https://people.gnome.org/~federico/blog/refactoring-some-repetitive-code-to-a-macro.html</link><description><![CDATA[I have started porting the code in librsvg that parses SVG's CSS properties from C to Rust.

One thing which multiple people have told me (over a time span of several years, actually) is that Rust is Special in that everyone uses crates for everything. Thus there is no point in having any sort of Rust support, the only true way is to blindly call Cargo and have it do everything exactly the way it wants to.

This seems like a reasonable recommendation so I did what every reasonable person would do and accepted this as is.

But then curiosity takes hold of you and you start to wonder.

I’ve been a reasonably active member of the C++ community for quite a while now, attending and contributing talks to conferences, following the development and evangelism of the language’s more modern features and of course writing lots of it. C++ is a language that gives its users very fine-grained control over all aspects of the program they are writing, at the cost of a steep learning curve and a large body of knowledge required to write effective C++. However, C++ is also a very old language, conceived by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1985, and thus caries a lot of technical debt even into modern standards.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">776dd5f1-c6d0-48da-8e0a-6fcae00fb923</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Peter Goldsborough</dc:creator></item><item><title>Encheapening Cernan Internal Metrics</title><link>http://blog.troutwine.us/2017/08/31/encheapening-cernan-internal-metrics/</link><description><![CDATA[In the new 0.7.x series of cernan we stumbled on a neat, cheap approach for making internal metrics available inside a rust codebase, an approach that has legs in other projects, I'd say.

However, since I’ve never really done any embedded development, I decided to start with the old standby: copying code off the internet!]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">3907940b-eb06-4f2a-a3ff-6df4ae5ac9ca</guid><pubDate>Thu,  1 Mar 2018 05:50:42 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Daniel Gallagher</dc:creator></item><item><title>Docker Multi-Stage Build</title><link>https://blog.jawg.io/docker-multi-stage-build/</link><description><![CDATA[On June 13, 2017 took place the Paris Container Day.

The best way to ensure they have a pleasant experience is to put yourself in their shoes. Forget the internal details of your package, and consider only its outward interface. Then, come up with a realistic use case and just implement it.

It would not be an exaggeration to say that embedded is omnipresent. You can find embedded firmware everywhere from fridges, microwaves and personal computers to safety-critical applications in automotive, medical fields, etc.

Most of this software is still written in C or C++, and neither of these, given their non-ideal track record in relation to security critical software, are the most confidence inspiring choice for safety-critical systems.

In my experience, bugs occurring in embedded firmware tend to be fairly similar to those commonly found in the user-space software.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">504ed65c-1efe-4cbd-b655-b17e89110936</guid><pubDate>Sat, 24 Feb 2018 20:09:27 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Simonas Kazlauskas</dc:creator></item><item><title>An introduction to writing platform agnostic drivers in Rust using the MCP3008</title><link>http://pramode.in/2018/02/24/an-introduction-to-writing-embedded-hal-based-drivers-in-rust/</link><description><![CDATA[Here is how a device like an accelerometer works: you send the device commands over a serial interface (SPI, I2C), say something like: “get me the X-axis reading”; the device responds by sending back some data.

The way the SPI/I2C/GPIO (and other) interfaces are programmed is very much dependent on the specific microcontroller family. But the actions you need to perform to interface with a device like a temperature sensor / accelerometer etc depend only on the device and are independent of the controller being used. What if you can write a generic accelerometer driver and use it on any microcontroller platform - right from low-end ARM Cortex-M, AVR, MSP430 etc to complex Embedded Linux platforms like the Raspberry Pi? What if you can distribute these drivers on crates.io so that you only have to include one line in your Cargo.toml to use it in your code?]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">34ee0b77-cabd-47a8-bb6c-00e8a34046c7</guid><pubDate>Sat, 24 Feb 2018 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><dc:creator>Pramode C.E</dc:creator></item><item><title>Pushing Rust To 2019</title><link>https://medium.com/@dumindu/pushing-rust-to-2019-9616d82172d3</link><description><![CDATA[Some of these suggestions are not entirely new and have been added as posts/ comments on /r/rust, Github threads.

However, both taking owneship of a value (moving it) or taking a reference to it can only happen after the value was created. This ordering seems to prevent having any cycle in a data structure, even though that’s sometimes useful or necessary. For example in a web page’s content tree, from any DOM node, one can easily access (if any) its first and last child, previous and next sibling, (so children of a node form a doubly-linked list) and parent. Some other applications might need to manipulate arbitrary graphs in their full generality.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">ff94e8a6-c203-4cbe-af46-8f99e2896dd8</guid><pubDate>Sat, 17 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Simon Sapin</dc:creator></item><item><title>Setting up Windows 10 for programming (in Rust)</title><link>https://exyr.org/2018/windows/</link><description><![CDATA[Lately I’ve been working with Windows-specific APIs, so I needed to get a Windows dev environment.

Whenever possible the compiler enforces memory safety at compile. One example of this is the borrow checker which prevents data races, iterator invalidation, pointer invalidation and other issues at compile time. Other memory problems like buffer overflows can’t be prevented at compile time. In those cases the compiler inserts runtime checks, bounds checks in this case, to enforce memory safety at runtime. What about stack overflows? For quite a long time Rust didn’t have stack overflow checking but that wasn’t much of a problem on tier 1 platforms since these platforms have an OS and a MMU (Memory Management Unit) that prevents stack overflows from wreaking havoc.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">45c32609-24ef-4288-b361-57ca8b5a34cd</guid><pubDate>Sat, 17 Feb 2018 18:16:39 +0100</pubDate><dc:creator>Jorge Aparicio</dc:creator></item><item><title>Mutation Testing Rust in Earnest</title><link>http://llogiq.github.io/2018/02/14/mutagen.html</link><description><![CDATA[It’s been a while since I last suggested Mutation Testing in Rust, almost two years ago.

As I said back then: I held myself to the same constraints as the original contest; no external packages is a bit painful in Rust, but it’s not too bad. Mostly it would let me eliminate boilerplate while also improving correctness, and making the code a bit shorter. So, that got me thinking: What would this look like if I could use external packages? I took about an hour, and knocked it out. I have two versions to show you today, one where I pay no attention to allocations, and one where it’s zero-allocation.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">938457b4-8905-4954-9007-88c80a2c24d6</guid><pubDate>Wed, 14 Feb 2018 10:12:15 -0800</pubDate><dc:creator>Steve Klabnik</dc:creator></item><item><title>Fanta: An opinionated framework for web development in rust</title><link>https://github.com/trezm/Fanta</link><description><![CDATA[Fanta is a web framework that aims for developers to be productive and consistent across projects and teams.
