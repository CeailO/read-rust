This ensures that all your samples stay up to date with your library’s API changes. However, there are some steps that need to happen to massage these “doctests” into something that can be compiled and run like a regular program.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">516e4eaf-1ce1-49be-a457-a471e9f97329</guid><pubDate>Fri, 23 Feb 2018 16:00:00 -0600</pubDate><dc:creator>QuietMisdreavus</dc:creator></item><item><title>Failure 1.0.0 on March 15</title><link>https://boats.gitlab.io/blog/post/2018-02-22-failure-1.0/</link><description>I’m planning to release a 1.0.0 version of failure on March 15. Once this happens, I don’t plan to release any further breaking changes to the failure crate (though maybe someday in the distant future).
Breaking changes in 1.0 failure is in a somewhat unique position as being a significant part of the public API of other libraries that depend on it. Whether they use the Error struct or derive Fail for a custom error type, this becomes a part of the API they expose to other users.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">b079d66f-d08e-4593-80cc-e0060133d12e</guid><pubDate>Thu, 22 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>boats</dc:creator></item><item><title>Recently, for a Rusty Web</title><link>http://seanmonstar.com/post/171170905822/recently-for-a-rusty-web</link><description>It’s been a few months since I shifted my focus full time to Rust, and in that time, we’ve gotten a lot of work done!

Memory management bugs are a common cause of these vulnerabilities. To that end, the Mozilla community has spent the last several years building the Rust language and ecosystem which focuses primarily on eliminating those bugs. And Rust is available in Fedora today, along with a few applications in Fedora 27 and higher, as seen below.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">c5a101b5-e749-4e99-9e08-54de2cf0a2c1</guid><pubDate>Wed, 21 Feb 2018 08:00:23 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Igor Gnatenko and Neal Gompa</dc:creator></item><item><title>How to write GStreamer Elements in Rust Part 2: A raw audio sine wave source</title><link>https://coaxion.net/blog/2018/02/how-to-write-gstreamer-elements-in-rust-part-2-a-raw-audio-sine-wave-source/</link><description>A bit later than anticipated, this is now part two of the blog post series about writing GStreamer elements in Rust. Part one can be found here, and I’ll assume that everything written there is known already. In this part, a raw audio sine wave source element is going to be written. It will be similar to the one Mathieu was writing in his blog post about writing such a GStreamer element in Python. Various details will be different though, but more about that later.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">0d46d60e-49c7-44ce-8f0c-48b94501b1ca</guid><pubDate>Wed, 21 Feb 2018 15:05:22 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Sebastian Dröge</dc:creator></item><item><title>Why Writing a Linked List in Rust is Basically Impossible [in safe Rust]</title><link>https://rcoh.me/posts/rust-linked-list-basically-impossible/</link><description>Before I start this post, let me preface it by saying that I’m not an experienced Rustacean by any means. Errata and corrections are appreciated. This post is aimed at helping other fledgling rust-learners avoid my mistake. First, by helping Rust learners pick good introductory projects that will fit naturally in idiomatic rust. Second, by helping Rust learners start building Rust-friendly design intuition. I’d heard about Rust and it’s inscrutable borrow checker for years, but after reading a few blog posts about compiler error improvements, I figured it might be user-friendly enough to give it a try.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">45772a5b-1f22-4db9-9eee-f888c0c82660</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2018 08:55:56 -0800</pubDate><dc:creator>Russell Cohen</dc:creator></item><item><title>Rust for Cross-Language System Libraries</title><link>https://libpasta.github.io/blog/bindings/</link><description>We have been building libpasta as a simple, usable solution to password hashing and migration. The goal for libpasta is to be a cross-platform, cross-language system library. libpasta is written in Rust, exports a C-style API, and builds to a static/shared library. Most languages support calling external libraries through foreign function interfaces (FFIs), and the end result can be seen in the documentation where each language has access to the libpasta functionality.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">3dc17991-d359-4205-917a-80b37a564b37</guid><pubDate>Wed, 21 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>libpasta</dc:creator></item><item><title>Snips Uses Rust to Build an Embedded Voice Assistant</title><link>https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2018/02/21/snips-uses-rust-build-embedded-voice-assistant/</link><description>The team at Paris-based Snips has created a voice assistant that can be embedded in a single device or used in a home network to control lights, thermostat, music, and more. You can build a home hub on a Raspberry Pi and ask it for a weather report, to play your favorite song, or to brew up a double espresso. Manufacturers like Keecker are adding Snips’ technology to products like multimedia home robots. And Snips works closely with leaders across the value chain, like NVIDIA, EBV, and Analog Devices, in order to voice-enable an increasingly wider range of device types, from speakers to home automation systems to cars.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">8e33c7c4-2788-418b-8e47-ca8990ae0d38</guid><pubDate>Wed, 21 Feb 2018 12:34:56 -0800</pubDate><dc:creator>Judy DeMocker</dc:creator></item><item><title>I decided to make an 1980&apos;s Home Computer in Rust - Part 1</title><link>http://railwayelectronics.blogspot.com.au/2018/02/i-decided-to-make-1980s-home-computer.html?m=1</link><description>My first attempt at Rust programming was the stellaris-launchpad crate. This has a few demos that either blink the LED or roll it through an RGB rainbow using the PWM timers. Recently I&apos;ve started a new version of the lm4f120 crate called tm4c123x-hal. The name change reflects TI&apos;s new name for basically the exact same part, while the -hal indicates that it&apos;s based upon the output of svd2rust and @japaric&apos;s new Embedded Hal crate. At the same time, I was watching videos on Youtube about a new wave of 1980&apos;s style &apos;retro&apos; computing boards - text output, BASIC interpreter, etc. An idea started to form that I could put all three of these things together.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">b2eb24c3-d7ee-438c-b041-0446dd551abe</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2018 22:16:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>theJPster</dc:creator></item><item><title>Programming an ARM microcontroller in Rust at four different levels of abstraction</title><link>http://pramode.in/2018/02/20/programming-a-microcontroller-in-rust-at-four-levels-of-abstraction/</link><description>Covering: Why Rust on Microcontrollers, Level 1: Direct register access in an unsafe block, Level 2: No unsafe blocks, use the API provided by svd2rust, A problem, Level 3: The embedded HAL to the rescue, Level 4: Use a board support crate.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">f2bf66c3-52bf-4a3c-b508-96bbd3385e8d</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2018 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><dc:creator>Pramode C.E</dc:creator></item><item><title>Using macro to generate generic docs?</title><link>https://blog.guillaume-gomez.fr/articles/2018-02-19+Using+macro+to+generate+generic+docs%3F</link><description>We were recently able to finally make the docs for integer primitive types much more accurate (thanks to @antoyo!).

It’s already week 8 and we have zero weekly driver posts out there – don’t worry though because there’s plenty of drivers and embedded-hal implementations in the works. To play catch up in this post I’ll cover two embedded-hal drivers: the l3gd20 and the lsm303dlhc. The L3GD20 is an IC that contains a gyroscope and exposes I2C and SPI interfaces; the LSM303DLHC is an IC that contains an accelerometer and a magnetometer, and exposes an I2C interface. You can find these two ICs on the STM32F3DISCOVERY board.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">25d98aac-94a1-4cda-bbdb-7b22b76ed032</guid><pubDate>Mon, 19 Feb 2018 15:57:59 +0100</pubDate><dc:creator>Jorge Aparicio</dc:creator></item><item><title>Ferrous Oxide For Jaguars And Incremented Crocodiles</title><link>https://eno.space/blog/2018/02/Ferrous-oxide-for-jaguars-and-incremented-crocodiles</link><description>Caveat lector: the primary purpose of the article is to introduce a reader proficient in one of the popular object-oriented languages how not to program in Rust.

Functions in Rust do not differ that much from Java methods but there are a few little differences. There is also the topic of Rust’s lifetimes compared to Java’s garbage collection that one could argue separates the two from each other a bit more, but for this post I will focus on the structure of writing a function in Rust. Due to the similarities between the two, I believe most Java developers will have no problem in figuring out what arguments a Rust function takes, what it outputs and where the output is returned from.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">e5f704af-b1ed-4757-b96d-80402ba3e601</guid><pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2018 18:28:19 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Dan Newton</dc:creator></item><item><title>Rust things I miss in C</title><link>https://people.gnome.org/~federico/blog/rust-things-i-miss-in-c.html</link><description>Librsvg feels like it is reaching a tipping point, where suddenly it seems like it would be easier to just port some major parts from C to Rust than to just add accessors for them.

However, both taking owneship of a value (moving it) or taking a reference to it can only happen after the value was created. This ordering seems to prevent having any cycle in a data structure, even though that’s sometimes useful or necessary. For example in a web page’s content tree, from any DOM node, one can easily access (if any) its first and last child, previous and next sibling, (so children of a node form a doubly-linked list) and parent. Some other applications might need to manipulate arbitrary graphs in their full generality.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">ff94e8a6-c203-4cbe-af46-8f99e2896dd8</guid><pubDate>Sat, 17 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Simon Sapin</dc:creator></item><item><title>Setting up Windows 10 for programming (in Rust)</title><link>https://exyr.org/2018/windows/</link><description>Lately I’ve been working with Windows-specific APIs, so I needed to get a Windows dev environment.

Whenever possible the compiler enforces memory safety at compile. One example of this is the borrow checker which prevents data races, iterator invalidation, pointer invalidation and other issues at compile time. Other memory problems like buffer overflows can’t be prevented at compile time. In those cases the compiler inserts runtime checks, bounds checks in this case, to enforce memory safety at runtime. What about stack overflows? For quite a long time Rust didn’t have stack overflow checking but that wasn’t much of a problem on tier 1 platforms since these platforms have an OS and a MMU (Memory Management Unit) that prevents stack overflows from wreaking havoc.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">45c32609-24ef-4288-b361-57ca8b5a34cd</guid><pubDate>Sat, 17 Feb 2018 18:16:39 +0100</pubDate><dc:creator>Jorge Aparicio</dc:creator></item><item><title>Mutation Testing Rust in Earnest</title><link>http://llogiq.github.io/2018/02/14/mutagen.html</link><description>It’s been a while since I last suggested Mutation Testing in Rust, almost two years ago.

For various reasons, it got brought up again in the D world, and seb has written a new post. It’s good, you should check it out! However, it links to my gist, not my blog post. As I said back then: I held myself to the same constraints as the original contest; no external packages is a bit painful in Rust, but it’s not too bad. Mostly it would let me eliminate boilerplate while also improving correctness, and making the code a bit shorter. So, that got me thinking: What would this look like if I could use external packages? I took about an hour, and knocked it out. I have two versions to show you today, one where I pay no attention to allocations, and one where it’s zero-allocation.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">938457b4-8905-4954-9007-88c80a2c24d6</guid><pubDate>Wed, 14 Feb 2018 10:12:15 -0800</pubDate><dc:creator>Steve Klabnik</dc:creator></item><item><title>Fanta: An opinionated framework for web development in rust</title><link>https://github.com/trezm/Fanta</link><description>Fanta is a web framework that aims for developers to be productive and consistent across projects and teams.

Those APIs have certain stages that can be controlled by the developer by using the correct shading language.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">b8e85b25-1d33-4b69-a3ba-b2cbac2bf62e</guid><pubDate>Fri,  9 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Maik Klein</dc:creator></item><item><title>Reflecting on ppbert</title><link>https://vfoley.xyz/ppbert/</link><description>I had an itch: I was pretty-printing the BERT-encoded terms that we use in a production system at work and it was very slow.

I decided to scratch that itch: I wrote ppbert, a command-line utility that reads BERT-encoded values and pretty-prints them.

Reflecting 2017 2017 was an amazing year for Rust. We got 8 releases of rust itself! We got basic procedural macros allowing custom derive (also known as “macros 1.1”) in the first release last year (1.15.0).

Before getting started, I’m very appreciative of the hard work put into the overall Rust community and ecosystem, including the behind-the-scenes work. It’s difficult to understate just how much time and energy people volunteer in pursuit of a better, Rust-ier world.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">6e9f2101-5cff-4356-95ea-43146f207fc5</guid><pubDate>Sun,  7 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Matthew Mayer</dc:creator></item><item><title>#Rust2018 blog post</title><link>https://gist.github.com/cessen/394829673855e56157f63b4447f91e67</link><description>#Rust2018 blog post</description><guid isPermaLink="false">dbe7f7e3-229a-4d77-8d9f-7d857c051b54</guid><pubDate>Sun,  7 Jan 2018 06:23:37 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Nathan Vegdahl</dc:creator></item><item><title>Improving how we improve Rust in 2018</title><link>http://www.jonathanturner.org/2018/01/rust2018-and-data.html</link><description>The past few years, I’ve been lucky to be part of the Rust community survey process.
