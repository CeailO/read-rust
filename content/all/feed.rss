In addition, it allows proving a much wider class of statements than just range proofs.

At Chain, we (Henry de Valence, Cathie Yun and Oleg Andreev) have been working on a pure-Rust Bulletproofs implementation, whose initial version we are publishing today, together with a set of notes.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">d412d980-cc59-4a0b-ab9e-19100f3b8927</guid><pubDate>Fri, 13 Apr 2018 19:21:27 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Chain</dc:creator></item><item><title>The Challenge of Using C in Safety-Critical Applications [pdf]</title><link>https://polysync.io/s/The-Challenge-of-Using-C-in-Safety-Critical-Applications.pdf</link><description>Software errors in safety-critical systems can have severe consequences: property-loss, environmental devastation, injury, or death. Despite the severity of these risks, software continues to be written for safety-critical applications in languages that permit common classes of failures, such as undefined behavior, state corruption, and unexpected termination. One such language is C. Language standards that define allowable subsets (e.g. MISRA) and static analysis tools are often used in an attempt to ameliorate these failures by detecting them in the program code before they result in a critical issue at runtime. These traditional methods are ultimately insufficient when it comes to providing ahead-of-time assurances about safe runtime behavior for safety-critical applications. Alternative approaches must be considered.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">30fe522c-e827-436a-bd52-40314d80e95b</guid><pubDate>Wed, 11 Apr 2018 08:54:41 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Shea Newton, Nathan Aschbache</dc:creator></item><item><title>Why would I use divergent functions?</title><link>https://medium.com/@yangnana11/rust-why-would-i-use-divergent-functions-d9dec59071bc</link><description>Rust has some special syntax for ‘diverging functions’, which are functions that do not return.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">2238849b-fcc8-4bd4-9828-66637c22f9af</guid><pubDate>Wed, 11 Apr 2018 08:54:41 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Yang Nana</dc:creator></item><item><title>Writing An NES Emulator with Rust and WebAssembly</title><link>https://medium.com/@bokuweb17/writing-an-nes-emulator-with-rust-and-webassembly-d64de101c49d</link><description>I wrote the NES emulator with Rust and WebAssembly to learn Rust.

In this post, I’d like to explore a little bit of the inner workings of how we can communicate between Rust (wasm) and JavaScript. As I mentioned in the last post, WebAssembly is neither JavaScript nor some strongly-typed dialect. It is a standalone, compiled, portable binary. How you send data into and get data out of that binary involves some subtle nuances about how WebAssembly works.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">fc25e5f3-66d9-429d-8ca8-c1882a5083d6</guid><pubDate>Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:14:05 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Kevin Hoffman</dc:creator></item><item><title>Rust all-hands (dev-tools stuff)</title><link>https://www.ncameron.org/blog/rust-all-hands-dev-tools-stuff/</link><description>Last week (sigh, the week before last now) we held an &apos;all-hands&apos; event in Berlin.

I ended up being assigned one on a type of machine learning algorithm called boosting. This wasn&apos;t my first choice unfortunately, so I decided I&apos;d try to make it interesting for myself by implementing it in Rust. Rust was, and still is, quite immature when it comes to machine learning - as Are We Learning Yet? confirms. I thought it would be an interesting challenge to write some machine learning algorithms in a language that has yet to be used too much for this field.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">e497ecb9-788c-476e-bb28-c1746fbff940</guid><pubDate>Fri, 30 Mar 2018 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Matthew Hall</dc:creator></item><item><title>The case for deadlines</title><link>https://gist.github.com/alkis/9510a840f1965185ab0a02cb59761dd8</link><description>Rust aims to be the foundation of fast and robust software.

I explained how they enable giving a safe API to code that could previously only be exposed with unsafe, and how one could go about proving such a thing. This post is about another application of pinned references—another API whose safety relies on the pinning guarantees: Intrusive collections. It turns out that pinned references can almost be used for this, but not quite. However, this can be fixed by extending the guarantees provided by pinned references, as suggested by @cramertj.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">68ff8b22-500f-4674-b9f0-b70414db12d8</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Ralf Jung</dc:creator></item><item><title>Sequoia-PGP - a modular OpenPGP implementation</title><link>https://sequoia-pgp.org/</link><description>Sequoia is a modular OpenPGP implementation in Rust.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">1282d538-71c9-4379-a330-820eccf83d22</guid><pubDate>Wed, 11 Apr 2018 06:52:00 +1000</pubDate><dc:creator>p≡p foundation</dc:creator></item><item><title>Getting Yew to work with Rust on ‘Bash on Ubuntu on Windows’</title><link>https://medium.com/@raymondsiu/getting-yew-to-work-with-rust-on-bash-on-ubuntu-on-windows-in-windows-10-790a006e6805</link><description>Yew is a new web framework written in Rust that takes concepts from React JS and Elm.

Since 2014, the industry has seen a huge loss due to memory vulnerabilities in TLS stacks, such as the infamous &quot;Heartbleed&quot; bug. MesaLink is created with the goal of eliminating memory vulnerabilities in TLS stacks. MesaLink is written in Rust, a programming language that guarantees memory safety. This significantly reduces the attack surfaces, which facilitates auditing and restricting the remaining attack surfaces. MesaLink is cross-platform and provides OpenSSL-compatible APIs. It works seamlessly in desktop, mobile, and IoT devices. With the growth of the ecosystem, MesaLink would also be adopted in the server environment in the future.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">afc97289-36f8-4acb-ab80-28e7770ea126</guid><pubDate>Fri,  6 Apr 2018 07:00:00 +1000</pubDate><dc:creator>MesaLock Linux</dc:creator></item><item><title>Improving GStreamer performance with tokio</title><link>https://coaxion.net/blog/2018/04/improving-gstreamer-performance-on-a-high-number-of-network-streams-by-sharing-threads-between-elements-with-rusts-tokio-crate/</link><description>For one of our customers at Centricular we were working on a quite interesting project. Their use-case was basically to receive an as-high-as-possible number of audio RTP streams over UDP, transcode them, and then send them out via UDP again. Due to how GStreamer usually works, they were running into some performance issues.

This blog post will describe the first set of improvements that were implemented for this use-case, together with a minimal benchmark and the results. My colleague Mathieu will follow up with one or two other blog posts with the other improvements and a more full-featured benchmark.

The short version is that CPU usage decreased by about 65-75%, i.e. allowing 3-4x more streams with the same CPU usage. Also parallelization works better and usage of different CPU cores is more controllable, allowing for better scalability. And a fixed, but configurable number of threads is used, which is independent of the number of streams.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">98f65a4a-8501-45e4-bda8-48d5d01306ba</guid><pubDate>Thu,  5 Apr 2018 15:21:06 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Sebastian Dröge</dc:creator></item><item><title>HTTP upgrades with hyper</title><link>http://seanmonstar.com/post/172531530657/http-upgrades-with-hyper</link><description>The newest release of hyper includes some lower-level connection APIs for both the server and client.

In the past, I’ve employed nginx as a high-performance cache and proxy, but it has been largely edged out by Envoy, which touts a hybrid non-blocking event model and has become wildly successful after being released in 2016. That very same principle, event-driven I/O, is the same reason I chose Node.js for most of the APIs I’ve developed since 2011. Even if practices change, we retain successful engineering models.

Beginning late last year, as I sketched our founding mission and initial product offerings, I also decided to select a new primary language that could handle most of our primary development tasks. After writing mostly JavaScript and compile-to-JS languages for half a decade, I longed for something more.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">680e9488-98e3-4a44-b462-761cf817ca10</guid><pubDate>Mon,  2 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Nicholas Young</dc:creator></item><item><title>Removing Connection State In mob</title><link>http://hermanradtke.com/2018/03/29/removing-connection-state-from-mob.html</link><description>I started writing mob, an multi-echo server using mio, in 2015.

In this post, I will walk through what I did to remove the need to track connection state. I wanted to remove the state because the implementation required an O(n) operation every tick of the mio event loop.

However talking to people new to Rust (and even brainstorming APIs with coworkers) it&apos;s hard to get rid of the feeling that Rust can be a mind bending adventure and that the best way to have a stress free experience is knowing upfront what you cannot (or should not attempt to) do. Knowing that certain things just cannot be done helps putting your mind back back on the right track.

So here are things not to do in Rust and what to do instead which I think should be better known.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">980f0166-c073-42bc-a1df-7dab36421e10</guid><pubDate>Sat, 31 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Armin Ronacher</dc:creator></item><item><title>Taking the long road (Part 1): bindings for a vector similarity search library</title><link>https://medium.com/@e_net4/taking-the-long-road-part-1-97e6e41f6b05</link><description>Perhaps you have once wondered how search engines such as Google and TinEye enable their users to search for images which are similar to one that you provide, or how they can identify a building from nothing but a picture.

There are different ways to guarantee memory safety for all programs. One is to restrict the programming language and disallow pointers. But, this forces most programs to make unnecessary copies of data. Another strategy, called garbage collection, embeds a garbage collector with every program. The garbage collector periodically looks for objects in memory that cannot be accessed from the program and reclaims this memory. The drawbacks of this are the overhead of garbage collection and that deallocation of memory is no longer under the control of the programmer.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">dc304d16-2ec3-45b1-833b-a9536c1a7d95</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Feb 2018 18:52:22 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Balagopal Komarath</dc:creator></item><item><title>Speeding Up &apos;dwarfdump&apos; With Rust</title><link>https://robert.ocallahan.org/2018/03/speeding-up-dwarfdump-with-rust.html</link><description>Writing a debugger for C++ on Linux, you spend a lot of time examining pretty-printed DWARF debug information using tools like readelf, objdump or dwarfdump.

A big Ruby or JavaScript (just to name a few) program in production is a never ending game of whack-a-mock – you fix one problem only to find a new one somewhere else. No matter how many tests you write, or how well-disciplined your team, any new development is sure to introduce a stream of bugs that will need to be shored up over the course of months or years.

Central to the problem are the edges. People will reliably do a good job of building and testing the happy paths, but as humans we’re terrible at considering the edge conditions, and it’s those edges and corners that cause trouble over the years that a program is in service.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">9f012379-d71a-4c45-b9db-12c4871070e7</guid><pubDate>Tue, 27 Mar 2018 14:45:57 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Brandur Leach</dc:creator></item><item><title>Designing a fast CLI join tool with rust</title><link>https://milancio42.github.io/blog/2018-03-22-rjoin/</link><description>(or how rust helped me to match the speed of GNU join written by Mike Haertel)</description><guid isPermaLink="false">cfc59513-ea0b-4d61-ac46-d7ea2e5bba8b</guid><pubDate>Thu, 22 Mar 2018 09:27:20 +0100</pubDate><dc:creator>Milan Opath</dc:creator></item><item><title>xray Update for March 26, 2018</title><link>https://github.com/atom/xray/blob/master/docs/updates/2018_03_26.md</link><description>Xray - An experimental next-generation Electron-based text editor.

Not only many things can happen all at once, but what you wrote in the code isn’t exactly what happens in the CPU. To gain some more performance, the compiler cheats if it thinks nobody is watching. It can reorder instructions or throw some of them out if they look useless. The same happens in the hardware. Furthermore, there isn’t just one RAM, but each memory location can live in different caches at each time and some of them are private to each CPU. It would not make do to publish all the local changes to one’s cache right away.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">eef1f270-fb75-475a-b10c-8e3813990362</guid><pubDate>Sun, 25 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Michal &apos;vorner&apos; Vaner</dc:creator></item><item><title>Refactoring some repetitive code to a Rust macro</title><link>https://people.gnome.org/~federico/blog/refactoring-some-repetitive-code-to-a-macro.html</link><description>I have started porting the code in librsvg that parses SVG&apos;s CSS properties from C to Rust.

Thus there is no point in having any sort of Rust support, the only true way is to blindly call Cargo and have it do everything exactly the way it wants to.

This seems like a reasonable recommendation so I did what every reasonable person would do and accepted this as is.

I’ve been a reasonably active member of the C++ community for quite a while now, attending and contributing talks to conferences, following the development and evangelism of the language’s more modern features and of course writing lots of it. C++ is a language that gives its users very fine-grained control over all aspects of the program they are writing, at the cost of a steep learning curve and a large body of knowledge required to write effective C++. However, C++ is also a very old language, conceived by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1985, and thus caries a lot of technical debt even into modern standards.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">776dd5f1-c6d0-48da-8e0a-6fcae00fb923</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Peter Goldsborough</dc:creator></item><item><title>Encheapening Cernan Internal Metrics</title><link>http://blog.troutwine.us/2017/08/31/encheapening-cernan-internal-metrics/</link><description>In the new 0.7.x series of cernan we stumbled on a neat, cheap approach for making internal metrics available inside a rust codebase, an approach that has legs in other projects, I&apos;d say.

In other words, this post is not a technical deep dive on how macros work, but focuses on the use cases for macros, and doesn’t require much knowledge about Rust to follow.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">c59a9688-62e5-4919-8687-e5ff82c3c5a3</guid><pubDate>Sun,  4 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Kasper Andersen</dc:creator></item><item><title>Serializing awkward data with serde</title><link>http://zork.net/~st/jottings/Serializing_awkward_data_with_serde.html</link><description>Recently I’ve been writing Rust code to work with a third-party data source in TOML format.

However, as I remarked, Rust’s famed flexibility leaves us little room to do mutations while keeping the type checker happy. For example, other mutation testing frameworks can mutate x + y to x - y.

This is an interesting mutation, because it’s so easy to do in languages like Java, which have full type information available at the bytecode level and so hard to do in Rust, because the std::ops traits make everything so hecking flexible.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">2f386775-d0a5-474b-a9de-c14af7453c40</guid><pubDate>Sat,  3 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Llogiq</dc:creator></item><item><title>Stopping a Rust worker</title><link>https://matklad.github.io/2018/03/02/stopping-a-rust-worker.html</link><description>This is a small post about a specific pattern for cancellation in the Rust programming language.

They are used to hold data within a logical unit that can be passed to other functions or execute their own methods on the values that they store. Now this sounds very familiar… Java objects do the same thing. For example if you took a POJO (Plain Old Java Object) you also pass it to other methods or execute the object’s own methods. In this nature they are alike, but they do have their differences. In this post we will look into creating structs, retrieving their values, defining their own methods and how to execute them.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">4c17c0f4-8148-4408-a54f-733e20c89189</guid><pubDate>Thu,  1 Mar 2018 20:03:54 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Dan Newton</dc:creator></item><item><title>Rust on the STMicro Nucleo</title><link>https://medium.com/@pdanielgallagher/rust-on-the-stmicro-nucleo-7a66b97be549</link><description>For the embedded portion of my project, I had two decisions to make: which processors and chips to use, and which language to write the firmware in.

The best way to ensure they have a pleasant experience is to put yourself in their shoes. Forget the internal details of your package, and consider only its outward interface. Then, come up with a realistic use case and just implement it.

In other words, you should create complete, end-to-end, and (somewhat) usable example applications.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">ca98f7f9-8927-48e9-8028-15e81f20f8a6</guid><pubDate>Wed, 28 Feb 2018 08:37:00 +0100</pubDate><dc:creator>Karol Kuczmarski</dc:creator></item><item><title>Fast Search Through Metric Spaces with Rust and BK Trees</title><link>https://www.innoq.com/en/blog/looks-the-same-to-me/</link><description>In the previous post, pHash helped us to summarize our photo album.

With Rust and its zero-cost abstractions, we found that there was no trade-off between performance and clean code.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">26bc7432-d561-4e1f-8cf2-2c30b8ac63ab</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Feb 2018 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate><dc:creator>Nick Fitzgerald</dc:creator></item><item><title>Transcript: Should you Rust in embedded yet?</title><link>https://kazlauskas.me/entries/rust-embedded-ready.html</link><description>This is a transcript of a talk I gave at the Vilnius Rust meetup.

It would not be an exaggeration to say that embedded is omnipresent. You can find embedded firmware everywhere from fridges, microwaves and personal computers to safety-critical applications in automotive, medical fields, etc.

Most of this software is still written in C or C++, and neither of these, given their non-ideal track record in relation to security critical software, are the most confidence inspiring choice for safety-critical systems.

In my experience, bugs occurring in embedded firmware tend to be fairly similar to those commonly found in the user-space software.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">504ed65c-1efe-4cbd-b655-b17e89110936</guid><pubDate>Sat, 24 Feb 2018 20:09:27 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Simonas Kazlauskas</dc:creator></item><item><title>An introduction to writing platform agnostic drivers in Rust using the MCP3008</title><link>http://pramode.in/2018/02/24/an-introduction-to-writing-embedded-hal-based-drivers-in-rust/</link><description>Here is how a device like an accelerometer works: you send the device commands over a serial interface (SPI, I2C), say something like: “get me the X-axis reading”; the device responds by sending back some data.

The way the SPI/I2C/GPIO (and other) interfaces are programmed is very much dependent on the specific microcontroller family. But the actions you need to perform to interface with a device like a temperature sensor / accelerometer etc depend only on the device and are independent of the controller being used. What if you can write a generic accelerometer driver and use it on any microcontroller platform - right from low-end ARM Cortex-M, AVR, MSP430 etc to complex Embedded Linux platforms like the Raspberry Pi? What if you can distribute these drivers on crates.io so that you only have to include one line in your Cargo.toml to use it in your code?</description><guid isPermaLink="false">34ee0b77-cabd-47a8-bb6c-00e8a34046c7</guid><pubDate>Sat, 24 Feb 2018 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><dc:creator>Pramode C.E</dc:creator></item><item><title>Pushing Rust To 2019</title><link>https://medium.com/@dumindu/pushing-rust-to-2019-9616d82172d3</link><description>Some of these suggestions are not entirely new and have been added as posts/ comments on /r/rust, Github threads.

Due to the similarities between the two, I believe most Java developers will have no problem in figuring out what arguments a Rust function takes, what it outputs and where the output is returned from.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">e5f704af-b1ed-4757-b96d-80402ba3e601</guid><pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2018 18:28:19 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Dan Newton</dc:creator></item><item><title>Rust things I miss in C</title><link>https://people.gnome.org/~federico/blog/rust-things-i-miss-in-c.html</link><description>Librsvg feels like it is reaching a tipping point, where suddenly it seems like it would be easier to just port some major parts from C to Rust than to just add accessors for them.

However, both taking owneship of a value (moving it) or taking a reference to it can only happen after the value was created. This ordering seems to prevent having any cycle in a data structure, even though that’s sometimes useful or necessary. For example in a web page’s content tree, from any DOM node, one can easily access (if any) its first and last child, previous and next sibling, (so children of a node form a doubly-linked list) and parent. Some other applications might need to manipulate arbitrary graphs in their full generality.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">ff94e8a6-c203-4cbe-af46-8f99e2896dd8</guid><pubDate>Sat, 17 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Simon Sapin</dc:creator></item><item><title>Setting up Windows 10 for programming (in Rust)</title><link>https://exyr.org/2018/windows/</link><description>Lately I’ve been working with Windows-specific APIs, so I needed to get a Windows dev environment.

Whenever possible the compiler enforces memory safety at compile. One example of this is the borrow checker which prevents data races, iterator invalidation, pointer invalidation and other issues at compile time. Other memory problems like buffer overflows can’t be prevented at compile time. In those cases the compiler inserts runtime checks, bounds checks in this case, to enforce memory safety at runtime. What about stack overflows? For quite a long time Rust didn’t have stack overflow checking but that wasn’t much of a problem on tier 1 platforms since these platforms have an OS and a MMU (Memory Management Unit) that prevents stack overflows from wreaking havoc.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">45c32609-24ef-4288-b361-57ca8b5a34cd</guid><pubDate>Sat, 17 Feb 2018 18:16:39 +0100</pubDate><dc:creator>Jorge Aparicio</dc:creator></item><item><title>Mutation Testing Rust in Earnest</title><link>http://llogiq.github.io/2018/02/14/mutagen.html</link><description>It’s been a while since I last suggested Mutation Testing in Rust, almost two years ago.

Mostly it would let me eliminate boilerplate while also improving correctness, and making the code a bit shorter. So, that got me thinking: What would this look like if I could use external packages?

The support for SQLite is almost as complete as the one for PostgreSQL: the only missing function is not implemented because the backend (SQLite) does not support it.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">35c70f95-6097-47df-a470-bb92e99b27e5</guid><pubDate>Sat, 10 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Antoni</dc:creator></item><item><title>Deploying A Rust Server to Google App Engine with Travis CI &amp; Docker</title><link>https://medium.com/@gallantmrgn/deploying-rust-server-to-google-app-engine-with-travis-ci-docker-b80acfce2ce5</link><description>I woke up this morning with one goal: to convert my website (morgangallant.com) into a Rust web server.

I decided to scratch that itch: I wrote ppbert, a command-line utility that reads BERT-encoded values and pretty-prints them.

In particular, I’ll stick to topics that would be helpful for my Neon project, a set of bindings for writing native Node extension modules in Rust.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">4d4b233f-fba3-4e3e-9e80-fe79603a38b0</guid><pubDate>Sat, 13 Jan 2018 17:45:00 -0800</pubDate><dc:creator>David Herman</dc:creator></item><item><title>Most desired from Rust in 2018</title><link>https://blog.mist.global/articles/Most_desired_from_Rust_in_2018.html</link><description>Recently there was a call for community blog posts themed about ideas and expectation for Rust in the coming year.

I’m known for being quite happy with Rust as is. Indeed, my first post on focusing on stable Rust was more than 2 years ago ;).

Also, note that I’ve been interested (and practically involved) in the growing and adoption of programming languages since around 2004, which was when I started doing users support for Ruby in Germany.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">2a2b7699-5a1a-4379-8a33-3faf4badd512</guid><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jan 2018 11:33:54 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Florian Gilcher</dc:creator></item><item><title>Rust - My wish list for 2018  · Murali&apos;s Blog </title><link>http://www.mmrath.com/post/rust-my-wish-list-for-2018/</link><description>I am excited about Rust after spending a little time with it last year.

Reflecting 2017 2017 was an amazing year for Rust. We got 8 releases of rust itself! We got basic procedural macros allowing custom derive (also known as “macros 1.1”) in the first release last year (1.15.0).

I found myself in pretty much complete agreement with Nick Cameron’s post, so I thought instead I would write about my own personal goals for Rust in 2018. I am fortunate enough to work on Rust full-time; modulated by the work that needs to get done to accomplish larger team goals, these are some things that I’m individually very motivated to make progress on in 2018.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">bd4a7ce1-c702-4965-b9c4-01e0ffca352b</guid><pubDate>Tue,  9 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>withoutboats</dc:creator></item><item><title>Looking back at Rust in 2018 • Steve Klabnik</title><link>http://words.steveklabnik.com/looking-back-at-rust-in-2018</link><description>A careful reader will note the date of this post; it’s fundamentally in response to this call for blog posts, with a rhetorical device of looking backwards as if my personal plans for Rust came true.
