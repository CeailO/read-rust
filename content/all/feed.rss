This is mine.

There are lots of cool technical improvements to Rust that I want the project to achieve this year, and a few in particular that I’m definitely going to be putting a lot of time into. But this blog post is going to talk about none of them. Instead, I want to talk about organizational debt, and how badly the Rust project needs to deal with it in 2019.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">f0adf24b-6589-4306-a580-6cef894ad3b7</guid><pubDate>Mon, 16 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>withoutboats</dc:creator></item><item><title>Notion: the hassle-free JavaScript toolchain manager</title><link>https://github.com/notion-cli/notion</link><description><![CDATA[Reliable: Ensure everyone in your project uses an identical dev environment, from the Node version to your preferred package manager.

Cur­rently rustc has a num­ber of MIR op­tim­isa­tions: a simple in­lin­er, ba­sic con­stant and copy propaga­tion, a single in­struc­tion com­bin­a­tion rule, a few graph sim­pli­fic­a­tion and clean up passes… The pat­tern here is clear – most of the op­tim­isa­tions we cur­rently have are ba­sic and lim­ited in their po­tency. Given the pace at which we man­aged to bring up MIR in the first place, one would be right to ex­pect… some­thing more.

As some­body who has made an at­tempt and failed to im­ple­ment a num­ber of data­flow-­based op­tim­isa­tions (a­mong other thing­s), I con­sider my­self fairly qual­i­fied to haz­ard a guess as to what is the reason for the cur­rent state we are at.

Salsa basically extracts the incremental recompilation techniques that we built for rustc into a general-purpose framework that can be used by other programs.

It has the STM32F100RBT6B MCU, capable of running at 24MHz. On the board, there is a 8MHz crystal. Naturally, when you are new to microcontrollers (like me), you may have a few questions: When we upload a program on this development board, at what speed it is actually running? Is it using this external crystal? Why is this crystal 8MHz if the MCU is capable of 24MHz? If our program is not running at the maximum speed, how do we make it run at the maximum speed?]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">c032fc9f-79b2-454f-914f-a32fda90092d</guid><pubDate>Sun, 27 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Nerijus Arlauskas</dc:creator></item><item><title>My Rust Powered linux.conf.au e-Paper Badge</title><link>http://www.wezm.net/technical/2019/01/linux-conf-au-rust-epaper-badge/</link><description><![CDATA[I attended linux.conf.au (for the first time) in Christchurch, New Zealand. It’s a week long conference covering Linux, open source software and hardware, privacy, security and much more. The theme this year was IoT. In line with the theme I built a digital conference badge to take to the conference. It used a tri-colour e-Paper display and was powered by a Rust program I built running on Raspbian Linux.

With a 9 hour drive I had a lot of time to think about things and so I spent a good majority of it thinking about OSS Governanace and Sustainability. What I came up with and thought of is the more concrete solutions to the problems I brought up in my Rust 2019 post. With the Rust All hands in Berlin only a few weeks away I wanted to get my thoughts in order by writing out some of the solutions to specific problems I came up with. Now, this doesn't mean they'll be accepted! We might even find better solutions! I just felt a need to articulate them as both a reference point and to make sure I've thought through them well. I'll be splitting them into a few posts so I can publish more faster, rather than write one long post that won't be published in time. With that in mind let's begin!]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">799301a7-d57a-4e9c-8412-aafc4e643f0a</guid><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jan 2019 04:20:23 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Michael Gattozzi</dc:creator></item><item><title>Performance of Rust&apos;s match vs. lookup tables</title><link>https://kevinlynagh.com/notes/match-vs-lookup/</link><description><![CDATA[I’ve been getting into bioinformatics algorithms lately and ran across an interesting pull request that improved performance by changing a Rust match expression to a lookup.

Layout is fundamental to any UI application. The layout engine is what takes a set of rules and figures out where to place elements on the screen. This sounds simple enough but as UIs become increasingly complex we rely more on the layout engine to be able to create these UIs as easily as possible. Not only should it be easy to build these UIs but the engine performing this work is also required to do so at minimum cost as it runs possibly on every frame (for example when performing layout animations).]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">cdb3ed72-c1a4-4ff2-8350-cb5768fd96d4</guid><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jan 2019 20:04:57 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Emil Sjölander</dc:creator></item><item><title>Non-Web Embeddings for Rust Wasm 2019</title><link>https://medium.com/wasmer/non-web-embeddings-for-rust-wasm-2019-7b290e94f81d</link><description><![CDATA[The Rust Wasm team has made tremendous progress in building robust developer tooling for Rust targeting WebAssembly on the Web in 2018.

Unfortunately, it falls apart in several fundamental areas when it comes to mathematical and scientific uses.

So do our customers, sometimes without even knowing it. We build software that is installed on devices that go out into the world, sometimes never to be seen again in years or even decades.

Historically we have been very successful doing just that, first in C and later in Java. Slowly but steadily, we are coming to rely on Rust to be able to create maintainable mission-critical software for our customers.

Therefore our proposal for the 2021 roadmap: Reliability.

To make my life easier, I wanted to leverage Linux’s FUSE interface to expose the audio on SoundCloud as a bunch of files in a folder which MPD could then index and play from. I could have taken a couple of other approaches such as swapping MPD with Mopidy, an MPD-compatible music player with SoundCloud support, or a scraper that periodically downloads the latest audio from my feed. And while these alternatives were probably easier to implement, I went for the FUSE driver because I thought it was cool.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">4a2d72d8-3aa4-4c82-a95f-847f3e0c650d</guid><pubDate>Wed,  2 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>polyfloyd</dc:creator></item><item><title>My wishlist for Rust in 2019</title><link>https://www.pietroalbini.org/blog/rust-2019-wishlist/</link><description><![CDATA[It's starting to become a tradition to see a bunch of posts around the new year on what the community wants to see from Rust.

Buckle up, we’re gonna cover a lot of things, and a lot of it is not fun. This is definitely one of those, “We really need to look at ourselves in the mirror” hard truths posts. As I type this though, I’ve reflecting on the past few years with the Rust community I’m just in awe of the amount of work, dedication, and passion that’s gone into it. I started Rust when I was still starting my career and finishing up my CS degree and now we have a brand spanking new edition! So much has changed that it’s honestly mind boggling thinking about it. Even at work I gave a history of Rust presentation and it was wild being able to go “back in the day” for something that was just a regular day a few years ago.

Now I find myself thinking about the problems we face as we become an even bigger community. We have a lot of problems. They’re good problems to have, but problems that must be solved eventually. I’m gonna go through all of them, what I see as major pain points/issues we’ve solved up to now, the present problems, and ones on the horizon. I’ll cover what I think we should focus on in the upcoming year and where we can go towards for Rust’s 2nd Edition.
