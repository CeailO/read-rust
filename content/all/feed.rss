This post will explain what ASM.js is, how to compile the parser into ASM.js, and how to use the ASM.js module with Javascript in a browser. The goal is to use ASM.js as a fallback to WebAssembly when it is not available. I highly recommend to read the previous episode about WebAssembly since they have a lot in common.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">10c577b9-fdf3-4aa3-80dd-78c6e4abb8c7</guid><pubDate>Tue, 28 Aug 2018 07:39:03 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Ivan Enderlin</dc:creator></item><item><title>Oxidizing sourmash: WebAssembly</title><link>https://blog.luizirber.org/2018/08/27/sourmash-wasm/</link><description><![CDATA[In "Oxidizing sourmash: Python and FFI" I described my road to learn Rust, but something that I omitted was that around the same time the WebAssembly support in Rust started to look better and better and was a huge influence in my decision to learn Rust.

It aims to make asynchronous programming easy (well, at least a little bit easier than it is today). The work has been on going for a while and is already usable today on the Rust nightly channel.

The tag library of choice was of course, taglib-sharp, a port of the C++ library TagLib to the .NET ecosystem. Since Rust unfortunately doesn’t have its own native port of TagLib, and any C bindings available didn’t expose the picture API, the most obvious thing to do was to use the C# library with Rust somehow, right?]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">4a0db6c9-2c0d-4455-b353-474e4f59c87a</guid><pubDate>Fri, 24 Aug 2018 01:07:46 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Ronny Chan</dc:creator></item><item><title>Why an Interior Mutable abstraction is needed in the Rust core library</title><link>http://blog.kjeka.com/rust/programming/tmcl/2018/08/24/interior-mut/</link><description><![CDATA[Interior mutabiliby is a concept known to anyone who have programmed in Rust for a while.

In addition to controlling access to secured resources, they are also used in sandboxing, event auditing, and specifying mandatory integrity levels.

In fact, an important part of the mission of the Unsafe Code Guidelines strike force is to deepen our understanding of what these invariants are.

However, in my view, there is also more than one invariant, matching the fact that there are (at least) two distinct parties relying on these invariants: The compiler, and (authors of) safely usable code. This came up often enough in recent discussions that I think it is worth writing it down properly once, so I can just link here in the future.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">7c167657-c185-479c-afc3-93b0187b8359</guid><pubDate>Wed, 22 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Ralf Jung</dc:creator></item><item><title>Another look at the pinning API</title><link>https://boats.gitlab.io/blog/post/rethinking-pin/</link><description><![CDATA[One thing has always nagged about the API we have right now though: the proliferation of different reference types that it implies. Today, the pin feature adds the PinMut and PinBox types, but in theory there ought to be a “pinned” version of every pointer in the standard library: PinRc and PinArc and so on. This is a very unfortunate consequence, but so far we have not found a good way to make pinning work compositionally - to have a single adapter that could be combined with any pointer.

Last night, a bit of inspiration struck me, and I realized that it is possible to make a compositional Pin type. This isn’t a fundamental change to the pinning model, just an API refactoring, but I’ve put a blocking concern on the proposal to stabilize Pin so that we can consider this possibility.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">edfe7063-b893-42db-aa08-61adcaddf56b</guid><pubDate>Wed, 22 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>boats</dc:creator></item><item><title>[blog series] From Rust to beyond: Prelude</title><link>https://mnt.io/2018/08/21/from-rust-to-beyond-prelude/</link><description><![CDATA[This series of posts is about those bindings, and explains how to send Rust beyond earth, into many different galaxies.

I’ve used other Graphics API’s before but never actually got my hands dirty into OpenGL. Someone on the rust user forums (they are awesome, go check it out!) suggested using compute shaders instead.

It’s memory management strategy is mostly the same, threading models are copied vanilla, both compile to native code and do about the same optimisations at that time, and traits and templates have a lot in common too. Both tend to be rather feature-rich languages with quite a lot to learn. While Rust is definitely better teacher (I’m looking at you, C++ error message!) and has many more „safety covers“ over the dangerous moving parts inside the engine, the design of the engine is more of an evolution from C++ than a completely new thing.

But I’ve noticed one rather subtle difference in the philosophy of the languages I’d like to describe here.

This will all be written from a C++ programmers standpoint that was thought writing Object Oriented code. I encourage you the reader to think critically and correct where necessary.

On to the actual first post! After reading “the Rust Programming Language” I wanted to get my hands dirty and actually write some code. I like graphical applications and using low level graphics API’s so I decided to implement a cellular automation in rust. But just implementing cellular automation isn’t very exciting, is it? What if we could do this on the GPU…And off I went on my journey to create Conway’s game of life in rust.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">b7c9c3df-7ecd-41f3-8c89-5c1d35298b7b</guid><pubDate>Tue,  7 Aug 2018 22:30:01 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Jonathan Steyfkens</dc:creator></item><item><title>Rust concurrency patterns: No context, no cancel, no leaks</title><link>https://medium.com/@polyglot_factotum/rust-concurrency-patterns-no-context-no-cancel-no-leak-b6c1ec2dafa5</link><description><![CDATA[Let’s put ourselves to the challenge of having an ‘infinite’ generator, which will have to be told to stop generating by the consumer…]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">bbb6ed5a-a451-4abf-bbff-2e0b33f6660a</guid><pubDate>Tue,  7 Aug 2018 10:54:56 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Gregory Terzian</dc:creator></item><item><title>Stacked Borrows: An Aliasing Model For Rust</title><link>https://www.ralfj.de/blog/2018/08/07/stacked-borrows.html</link><description><![CDATA[In this post, I am proposing “Stacked Borrows”: A set of rules defining which kinds of aliasing are allowed in Rust.

A popular way to add logging to Rust code is to use the log crate. However, the log create is just a facade, and by default the messages do not get emitted anywhere. The calling code has to set up a logger. Crates like env_logger let one set up a logger, during program initialization, that gets configured through an environment variable. This is a problem for librsvg: we are not the program's initialization! Librsvg is a library; it doesn't have a main() function. And since most of the calling code is not Rust, we can't assume that they can call code that can initialize the logging framework.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">d711d36a-fa00-4b26-a367-26b70589af2e</guid><pubDate>Fri,  3 Aug 2018 19:29:43 -0500</pubDate><dc:creator>Federico Mena Quintero</dc:creator></item><item><title>Working on the Embedded Rust Book</title><link>https://jamesmunns.com/blog/working-on-the-book/</link><description><![CDATA[TL;DR: Up to now, I haven't had as much time or motivation as I would have like to contribute to the Embedded Rust Book.

They offer a way to work with higher kinded types – a necessity in a couple of situations. A common example is the streaming iterator: an iterator able to return items borrowing from self (the iterator itself). Unfortunately, GATs haven’t even landed in nightly yet. So while are waiting, we can try tackling the streaming iterator problem without GATs. In this post we explore three possible workarounds for situations where an associated type depends on the lifetime of a &self receiver.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">2cc12b2e-22fb-461a-be01-ffeab54caa9f</guid><pubDate>Fri,  3 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Lukas Kalbertodt</dc:creator></item><item><title>CLion IDE Rust plugin update: language support improvements, new quick-fixes, improved debugger and more</title><link>https://blog.jetbrains.com/clion/2018/08/intellij-rust-update-2018_2/</link><description><![CDATA[CLion 2018.2 was released just recently.

This sort of thing is common when buying used CDs, especially if they need to transit a USPS international shipping center.

Their paper also describes a parallel version of their formulas, designed to execute four streams of instructions on four independent processors. Until now, these parallel formulas don’t seem to have been implemented in software. But a closer look reveals that slightly modifying the formulas allows the expensive instructions to be executed in uniform, making a vectorized SIMD implementation possible.

I implemented this strategy in Rust, targeting 256-bit wide AVX2 operations. The resulting implementation performs double-base scalar multiplication faster than other Ed25519 implementations I tested, and is even faster than FourQ without endomorphisms]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">8a924e9f-d803-4e85-b2e8-92b5909c7695</guid><pubDate>Wed,  1 Aug 2018 17:41:42 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Henry de Valence</dc:creator></item><item><title>Sequoia, a new OpenPGP implementation</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/93mng5/ann_sequoia_a_new_openpgp_implementation/</link><description><![CDATA[This past fall, three former GnuPG developers began working on a new OpenPGP implementation in Rust called Sequoia.
