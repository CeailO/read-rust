It’s unlike anything I’ve ever seen. Not only are we seeing an ever-growing number of big name users of Rust, we also continue to see leaps in productivity and functionality. Yesterday, the Rust 2018 edition shipped. The culmination of three years of work, it shows off what the community is capable of: new features, backwards compatibility, new ergonomics without sacrificing performance, and the list goes on and on.

Which is why it might comes as a little bit of a surprise that I suggest we let the field rest for the year. More specifically, that we should let one field rest while we plant another. Rather than focusing on new designs, I suggest we turn our attention outside of RFCs to other areas of Rust.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">8f026251-f6df-4816-a89f-855741aacbf6</guid><pubDate>Sat,  8 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Jonathan Turner</dc:creator></item><item><title>A simple agenda for the Rust Game Development WG</title><link>https://medium.com/rustgamedev/a-simple-agenda-for-the-rust-game-development-wg-485cfc72b088</link><description><![CDATA[Proposing Amethyst as our flagship project.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">e7334cc0-fe8a-4b16-b96f-c25b2073dc52</guid><pubDate>Fri,  7 Dec 2018 23:51:48 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Erlend S.

In the last RustFest, Amanieu was experimenting on integrating his crate into stdlib, which turned out to have some really promising results. As a result, it’s being planned to move the crate into stdlib.

While the integration is still ongoing, there’s currently no blog post out there explaining SwissTable at the moment. So, I thought I’d dig deeper into the Rust implementation to try and explain how its (almost) identical twin hashbrown::HashMap works.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">4ea6d02a-6279-4eef-af2f-bd67424d6de8</guid><pubDate>Fri,  7 Dec 2018 16:58:46 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Ravi Shankar</dc:creator></item><item><title>Plans for 2019</title><link>https://pcwalton.github.io/2018/12/07/plans-for-2019.html</link><description><![CDATA[Many people have asked me what I’m working on lately, and I thought I’d give a quick rundown of my status and plans for 2019.

As far as communication with JavaScript went, you had to work with raw wasm imports and exports yourself. That meant you could only pass 32- and 64-bit integers and floats back and forth. No Rust structs, JavaScript objects, strings, or slices could be passed back forth. And distributing your library’s .wasm so that other downstream projects could depend on it? Good luck.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">c0eb769f-4785-436d-b0b9-4bff16b30ef8</guid><pubDate>Thu,  6 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Rust and WebAssembly</dc:creator></item><item><title> A call for Rust 2019 Roadmap blog posts</title><link>https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/12/06/call-for-rust-2019-roadmap-blogposts.html</link><description><![CDATA[Starting today and running until of January 15, we’d like to ask the community to write blogposts reflecting on Rust in 2018 and proposing goals and directions for Rust in 2019.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">3234baba-f03d-467c-b032-d7d0dec7a12d</guid><pubDate>Thu,  6 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>The Rust Community Team</dc:creator></item><item><title> Announcing Rust 1.31 and Rust 2018</title><link>https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/12/06/Rust-1.31-and-rust-2018.html</link><description><![CDATA[The Rust team is happy to announce a new version of Rust, 1.31.0, and "Rust 2018" as well.

Read more details about the features and architecture of the Firecracker VMM at Firecracker Design.

Firecracker microVMs improve efficiency and utilization with a low memory overhead of < 5 MiB per microVMs. This means that you can pack thousands of microVMs onto a single machine. You can use an in-process rate limiter to control, with fine granularity, how network and storage resources are shared, even across thousands of microVMs. All hardware compute resources can be safely oversubscribed, to maximize the number of workloads that can run on a host.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">50e86e16-57e4-4740-8251-b7eb6340d9ad</guid><pubDate>Tue, 27 Nov 2018 05:02:08 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Arun Gupta</dc:creator></item><item><title>Tide’s evolving middleware approach</title><link>https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/wg-net/2018/11/27/tide-middleware-evolution.html</link><description><![CDATA[Since the last post on Tide, there have been a number of excellent contributions from a bunch of new contributors!

More specifically, I’ve been writing the glsl crate for a while now and the current, in-use parser is backed with nom. nom is a parser combinator crate written originally by @geal and there has been a lot of fuzz around nom vs. pest lately.

Soooooooooooo. Because glsl is written with nom in its third iteration and because nom is now at version 4, I decided it was time to update the parser code of glsl. I heard about the comparison between pest and nom and decided to write an implementation with pest.

This is the first article of a series about how writing a pest looks like is fun compared to writing the nom parser. I’ll post several articles as I advance and see interesting matter to discuss and share.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">2a3a85cf-b4ac-49ff-9a27-4d377cd3d0cb</guid><pubDate>Sat, 17 Nov 2018 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Dimitri Sabadie</dc:creator></item><item><title>Build Your Own Shell using Rust</title><link>https://www.joshmcguigan.com/blog/build-your-own-shell-rust/</link><description><![CDATA[This is a tutorial on building your own shell using Rust, in the spirit of the build-your-own-x list.

That’s easy, for that we have thebacktrace-rs crate, right?

As you may know, the borrow checker is designed to safely handle memory allocation and ownership, preventing accessess to invalid memory and ensuring data-race freedom.

In this post, we’ll see how these facilities can be used to enforce higher-level API constraints in your libraries and software.

A single day of request logs is usually around 500 gigabytes on disk. So every day, we generate about 500 files that are 85MB on disk, and contain about a million streaming JSON objects that take up 1GB when uncompressed. What we want out of those files is incredibly tiny—a few thousand integers, labelled with names and version numbers. Without any real idea of how to get those counts out of S3, I started by writing a proof of concept Ruby script that could parse one of the 500 log files and print out stats from it. Even on my super-fast laptop, my prototype script would take more than 16 hours to parse 24 hours worth of logs.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">80d71718-3acf-49d1-ad47-3e05c5da17a2</guid><pubDate>Thu, 25 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Andre Arko</dc:creator></item><item><title>Announcing Rust 1.30</title><link>https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/10/25/Rust-1.30.0.html</link><description><![CDATA[The Rust team is happy to announce a new version of Rust, 1.30.0.

First, I’m completely invested in Go because of InfluxDB. Second, I heard that it was not the easiest thing to learn. While I don’t normally shy away from difficult tasks, I was hesitant because I believe that many developer tools that take off do so because they are easy to use or give developers significant productivity gains.

From what I had been doing in C#, none of it utilized multiple threads. Multi-threaded programming had always been a sore topic for me. Things like thread synchronization and message passing never really made sense to me. I learned Rust mainly due to its promises for ease of programming for multiple threads. Once hearing that things like parts of Firefox were written using it, and the Mozilla themselves were very strongly invested in Rust, I had more reason to start writing in it. I’d assume that if Mozilla were to invest so much in a programming language, it must have some sort of benefits over your usual C and C++ programming languages. Even further than that, I’ve heard of some game studios adopting Rust in their games and I was pretty much hooked at that point.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">60825132-c54b-4297-9f81-936601b76f64</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Oct 2018 02:29:02 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Nathaniel Barragan</dc:creator></item><item><title>Release of glsl-quasiquote-0.2 with support for GLSL pragmas</title><link>https://phaazon.net/blog/glsl-quasiquote-0.2</link><description><![CDATA[glsl-quasiquote-0.2 was released early this morning.
