      "content_text": "Rust is an amazing project. It’s unlike anything I’ve ever seen. Not only are we seeing an ever-growing number of big name users of Rust, we also continue to see leaps in productivity and functionality. Yesterday, the Rust 2018 edition shipped. The culmination of three years of work, it shows off what the community is capable of: new features, backwards compatibility, new ergonomics without sacrificing performance, and the list goes on and on.\n\nWhich is why it might comes as a little bit of a surprise that I suggest we let the field rest for the year. More specifically, that we should let one field rest while we plant another. Rather than focusing on new designs, I suggest we turn our attention outside of RFCs to other areas of Rust.",

All the while being vastly easier to learn, and to use correctly and efficiently at the same time.",
