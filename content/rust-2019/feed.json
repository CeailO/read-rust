I would like to hope my experience is repeatable, and that 2019 is the year that Rust can transcend the notion of being a bleeding-edge science experiment and instead settle down into being a “boring in a good way” practical language with a growing community developing and deploying production-quality software.",

Rust has a lot going for it in terms of package management, speed, and typing.\n\nUnfortunately, it falls apart in several fundamental areas when it comes to mathematical and scientific uses. Some of these are ecosystem problems (i.e. the work just isn't there) and some of it are more core problems (e.g. type-level numerics, which will be solved Soon™, hopefully).",

As I type this though, I’ve reflecting on the past few years with the Rust community I’m just in awe of the amount of work, dedication, and passion that’s gone into it. I started Rust when I was still starting my career and finishing up my CS degree and now we have a brand spanking new edition! So much has changed that it’s honestly mind boggling thinking about it. Even at work I gave a history of Rust presentation and it was wild being able to go “back in the day” for something that was just a regular day a few years ago.\n\nNow I find myself thinking about the problems we face as we become an even bigger community. We have a lot of problems. They’re good problems to have, but problems that must be solved eventually. I’m gonna go through all of them, what I see as major pain points/issues we’ve solved up to now, the present problems, and ones on the horizon.

I am overall very satisfied with Rust, but sometimes I come across something that doesn't work as I hoped.

Followed by a sizeable hiatus (lack of personal time), I came back mid-year 2018. I can say for certain that the focus on usability and ergonomics was successful. Rust is much easier to use now than it was then. Rust format (rustfmt), Rust language server (RLS), text editor support, cargo tooling, compiler messages, and ecosystem crates’ quality and diversity are all amazing. The community is crazy diverse (first language learners, experienced systems people, web-dev people, programming language theory people, etc…).

I should note that I am speaking only for myself, not anyone else, and not even as a very active participant in Rust anymore. Moreover these suggestions, to a large extent, apply to many projects. Rust is just one case, but one that is currently doing some conscious year-end reflection. I should also note overall that I'm quite pleased by the trajectory of the Rust project and this suggestion is being made only in the spirit of keeping it healthy and on-track, avoiding some problems I observe developing in it, as a mostly-outsider these days.",

But even with a hundred plus posts that didn’t happen, so this year it’s the moment to speak up. I have used many different languages in past and when I started studying Rust at version 1.0 I was quickly impressed by its very good design, I was mostly in agreement with most of its design decisions, despite every useful language has a messy implementation. Even small things were designed with care. And I loved how much Rust cares for code correctness. I prefer to avoid long debug sessions and to use more time in the design and coding phases. So I’ve kept learning and using it ever since. For 2019 and beyond I’d like Rust to keep working on finishing its many unfinished parts.",

      "content_text": "I think there is too much unfinished and unpolished stuff in Rust. My wish for 2019 would be to ship most of this. If I had to choose a theme for Rust 2021 that would be \"Reliability\", to convey that what is shipped has actually been polished to the point that it does not fail.",

      "content_text": "I think Rust could help at the task of writing performant computational software, because its expressiveness, flexibility and degree of low-level control rivals that of C++, which is the de facto dominant programming language of this community where sophisticated abstractions and high performance are both desired. All the while being vastly easier to learn, and to use correctly and efficiently at the same time.",
