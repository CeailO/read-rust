This is mine.

There are lots of cool technical improvements to Rust that I want the project to achieve this year, and a few in particular that I’m definitely going to be putting a lot of time into. But this blog post is going to talk about none of them. Instead, I want to talk about organizational debt, and how badly the Rust project needs to deal with it in 2019.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">f0adf24b-6589-4306-a580-6cef894ad3b7</guid><pubDate>Mon, 16 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>withoutboats</dc:creator></item><item><title>cargo-crev and Rust 2019 fearless code reuse</title><link>https://dpc.pw/cargo-crev-and-rust-2019-fearless-code-reuse</link><description><![CDATA[In my opinion, one of the biggest reasons why Rust is so productive is that it's a superb language for code reuse. Despite all these strengths, there's one problem that sticks out like a sore thumb: trust. Every additional dependency is another piece of code that could be buggy, or even malicious. And in my opinion, it's problem so serious, that is entirely blocking the untapped potential of code reuse in Rust.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">ae506c52-88d5-4803-ade0-610f083298ae</guid><pubDate>Sat, 29 Dec 2018 04:43:26 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Dawid Ciężarkiewicz aka `dpc`</dc:creator></item><item><title>My Rust 2019 Dream: Dominate the Web</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/aac8zk/my_rust_2019_dream_dominate_the_web/?st=JQ8PQ5Z8&amp;sh=3ad6032f</link><description><![CDATA[A lot of people already know Rust is a great systems language. It can be put on embedded, feels better than C/C++ in many ways, and concurrency is way better than it was before. It's almost no doubt that Rust will continue to grow in these realms. The opportunity I see Rust has to lose though, is being the defacto language of the future of serious web programming. The dream I see is Rust as the language every one uses to create backend, front end, and perhaps even the distributed web ( wasm distributed apps on blockchain implementations).]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">89df3ecf-8eeb-4da6-9945-3d69b6095f5e</guid><pubDate>Sat, 29 Dec 2018 00:04:23 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>u/richardanaya</dc:creator></item><item><title>Rust 2019 - Usability and Tools</title><link>https://crepererum.net/rust-2019-stabilization-and-ecosystem/</link><description><![CDATA[This is my personal answer to the call for Rust 2019 Roadmap blog posts.

My first encounter with Rust was pre-1.0 (early 2015) and I immediately saw that Rust would be my future, wherein I joked to colleagues that I’d use it to “make toasters talk”. Followed by a sizeable hiatus (lack of personal time), I came back mid-year 2018. I can say for certain that the focus on usability and ergonomics was successful. Rust is much easier to use now than it was then. Rust format (rustfmt), Rust language server (RLS), text editor support, cargo tooling, compiler messages, and ecosystem crates’ quality and diversity are all amazing. The community is crazy diverse (first language learners, experienced systems people, web-dev people, programming language theory people, etc…). The chaos is well-managed with self-organizing working groups.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">53e4c3d4-a70a-4caa-a4c8-17be048c93df</guid><pubDate>Fri, 28 Dec 2018 16:49:44 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Josh Bowles</dc:creator></item><item><title>My Wish List For Rust 2019</title><link>https://haurchefant.fr/posts/2018/12/my-wishlist-for-rust-2019/</link><description><![CDATA[For the first time, I’m writing for the Rust Roadmap blog posts call.

I should note that I am speaking only for myself, not anyone else, and not even as a very active participant in Rust anymore. Moreover these suggestions, to a large extent, apply to many projects. Rust is just one case, but one that is currently doing some conscious year-end reflection. I should also note overall that I'm quite pleased by the trajectory of the Rust project and this suggestion is being made only in the spirit of keeping it healthy and on-track, avoiding some problems I observe developing in it, as a mostly-outsider these days.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">1155adc5-9d95-4185-97bb-742e3c0bd446</guid><pubDate>Wed, 26 Dec 2018 11:29:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Graydon Hoare</dc:creator></item><item><title>Rust 2019: Ignorant Thoughts</title><link>http://www.russet.org.uk/blog/3207</link><description><![CDATA[I’ve written a single library in Rust, called Horned-OWL for manipulating OWL. The experience has been positive. There is already a good and complete library for manipulating OWL called the OWL API, so I needed a strong motivation for writing another. That motivation is simple: the OWL API is in Java and it is slow. Rust has fulfilled it’s promise for me; Horned-OWL is an order of magnitude faster thatn the OWL API. What have I learned from the experience though, and what could be improved?]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">5a894193-9c56-4f80-8e38-546cadf5da44</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Dec 2018 09:05:36 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Phillip Lord</dc:creator></item><item><title>Rust in 2019</title><link>https://blog.strake.me.uk/archives/93</link><description><![CDATA[Rust made good progress in 2018: const fn in particular was a welcome and sorely needed feature.

After all, Rust 2015 (a.k.a 1.0) was all about stabilization and the team has actually done a pretty good job with achieving this goal. So what gives?

While Rust 2015 defined stabilization around language backward compatibility, it’s time for the language, the tooling, the ecosystem and the governance to stabilize. Each of these characterize stability in a different way. Let me explain a bit more what I mean.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">1b761099-8ee4-4e1c-86b1-2aeac151507c</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Ryan Levick</dc:creator></item><item><title>My wishlist for Rust ‘19</title><link>https://apiraino.github.io/2018/12/19/call-for-2019-roadmap.html</link><description><![CDATA[This isn’t exactly a blog so this won’t be exactly a “post”, but I’d like to write down my thoughts on this notepad answering the call for a wishlist for Rust 2019.

On top of that, I would like to see more ecosystem work to make embedded applications more feasible and easy to use.

For the kinds of things that I want to do (e.g. my path tracer), there isn't much that Rust is lacking as a language. There are some fiddly things like "placement new" that could be useful, but nothing really major. And of course, well-designed new features are always welcome, they just don't seem particularly critical to me at this point. In other words, I'm pretty much satisfied. Mission accomplished, as far as I'm concerned. I think the rest is just polish.

But even with a hundred plus posts that didn’t happen, so this year it’s the moment to speak up. I have used many different languages in past and when I started studying Rust at version 1.0 I was quickly impressed by its very good design, I was mostly in agreement with most of its design decisions, despite every useful language has a messy implementation. Even small things were designed with care. And I loved how much Rust cares for code correctness. I prefer to avoid long debug sessions and to use more time in the design and coding phases. So I’ve kept learning and using it ever since. For 2019 and beyond I’d like Rust to keep working on finishing its many unfinished parts.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">db72fed1-63a5-41eb-868f-716f694cd52e</guid><pubDate>Sun,  9 Dec 2018 11:38:40 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>leonardo</dc:creator></item><item><title>Rust 2019 — let us pursue composability</title><link>https://medium.com/@GolDDranks/rust-2019-let-us-pursue-composability-70f1eb2238c3</link><description><![CDATA[We should drive home the goals set in spirit of productivity in 2019.

It’s unlike anything I’ve ever seen. Not only are we seeing an ever-growing number of big name users of Rust, we also continue to see leaps in productivity and functionality. Yesterday, the Rust 2018 edition shipped. The culmination of three years of work, it shows off what the community is capable of: new features, backwards compatibility, new ergonomics without sacrificing performance, and the list goes on and on.

Which is why it might comes as a little bit of a surprise that I suggest we let the field rest for the year. More specifically, that we should let one field rest while we plant another.
