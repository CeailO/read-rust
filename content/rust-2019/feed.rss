My main wish for the new year is to put on the breaks a little bit, and finish off what has been started without taking on anything majorly new.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">fde9a5b7-9e92-41aa-994a-15bdb87d2909</guid><pubDate>Fri, 14 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>cetra3</dc:creator></item><item><title>Sinistersnare&apos;s Rust 2019 Wishlist</title><link>https://drs.is/post/rust-wishlist-2019/</link><description><![CDATA[Rust needs to focus on less glamorous features in 2019. We have added a lot of great features since 1.0, but we need to address the warts that we have had for a long time. I mostly echo sentiments from Jonathan Turner, Nathan Vegdahl, and many others in my ‘fallow-year’ sentiments. Overall, Compilation speed and generic constants are my two most wished-for features. On top of that, I would like to see more ecosystem work to make embedded applications more feasible and easy to use. Finally, Rust needs a moratorium on adding syntactic sugar for 2019.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">9e8f8e34-8fe9-4b4b-b40a-970e0a85a993</guid><pubDate>Wed, 12 Dec 2018 08:10:44 -0500</pubDate><dc:creator>Davis Ross Silverman</dc:creator></item><item><title>Rust 2019 - It&apos;s the Little Things</title><link>https://blog.cessen.com/post/2018_12_12_rust_2019_its_the_little_things</link><description><![CDATA[This might be an uncommon opinion—especially among those motivated enough to write a Rust 2019 post—but I actually think Rust is pretty much at a good place now. For the kinds of things that I want to do (e.g. my path tracer), there isn't much that Rust is lacking as a language. There are some fiddly things like "placement new" that could be useful, but nothing really major. And of course, well-designed new features are always welcome, they just don't seem particularly critical to me at this point. In other words, I'm pretty much satisfied. Mission accomplished, as far as I'm concerned. I think the rest is just polish. Just the little things.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">a884801e-f80b-4ea4-8441-a86c2c736086</guid><pubDate>Wed, 12 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Nathan Vegdahl</dc:creator></item><item><title>Rust 2019: Think Bigger</title><link>http://fitzgeraldnick.com/2018/12/11/rust-2019-think-bigger.html</link><description><![CDATA[Rust shines when we find ways to have our cake and eat it too: memory safety without runtime garbage collection, abstraction without overhead, threading without data races.

In case you missed it, we released our second edition of Rust this year! An edition is an opportunity to make backwards incompatible changes, but more than that it's an opportunity to bring attention to how programming in Rust has changed. With the 2018 edition out of the door, now is the time to think about the next edition: how do we want programming in Rust in 2022 to be different to programming in Rust today? Once we've worked that out, lets work backwards to what should be done in 2019.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">4259e940-d508-4de3-8971-3c3df7b30f98</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Dec 2018 04:34:31 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Nick Cameron</dc:creator></item><item><title>Lokathor&apos;s Rust 2019 wishpost</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/a4ygji/lokathors_rust_2019_wishpost</link><description><![CDATA[Recently I've been using Rust for GBA development (repo link), and before that I spent most of my Rust time with Handmade Hero work (the actual repo is private to handmade hero backers, so that link is just the main website). As you might expect, this has given me a quite different view of what I want to see from Rust. Basically, I don't want more crates. I want language, and tools, and most importantly education.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">dcaa5235-2614-4f61-b0b4-8b1f2e0d136e</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Dec 2018 05:47:42 +1100</pubDate><dc:creator>u/Lokathor</dc:creator></item><item><title>Rust 2019 — let us pursue composability</title><link>https://medium.com/@GolDDranks/rust-2019-let-us-pursue-composability-70f1eb2238c3</link><description><![CDATA[We should drive home the goals set in spirit of productivity in 2019.

So here’s my take. I’ll start by looking back at the last year. We’ve seen great and impactful changes in the Rust landscape, such as non-lexical lifetimes, the stabilization of procedural macros and const fn, stable clippy and rustfmt, the further development of powerful IDE integration such as IntelliJ, Atom and VSCode.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">57aae12d-0d27-4eec-b3f3-4ff99f294435</guid><pubDate>Sat,  8 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Llogiq</dc:creator></item><item><title>The Fallow Year, my Rust2019 post</title><link>https://www.jonathanturner.org/2018/12/the-fallow-year.html</link><description><![CDATA[Rust is an amazing project. It’s unlike anything I’ve ever seen. Not only are we seeing an ever-growing number of big name users of Rust, we also continue to see leaps in productivity and functionality. Yesterday, the Rust 2018 edition shipped. The culmination of three years of work, it shows off what the community is capable of: new features, backwards compatibility, new ergonomics without sacrificing performance, and the list goes on and on.

Which is why it might comes as a little bit of a surprise that I suggest we let the field rest for the year. More specifically, that we should let one field rest while we plant another. Rather than focusing on new designs, I suggest we turn our attention outside of RFCs to other areas of Rust.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">8f026251-f6df-4816-a89f-855741aacbf6</guid><pubDate>Sat,  8 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Jonathan Turner</dc:creator></item><item><title>A simple agenda for the Rust Game Development WG</title><link>https://medium.com/rustgamedev/a-simple-agenda-for-the-rust-game-development-wg-485cfc72b088</link><description><![CDATA[Proposing Amethyst as our flagship project.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">e7334cc0-fe8a-4b16-b96f-c25b2073dc52</guid><pubDate>Fri,  7 Dec 2018 23:51:48 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Erlend S.
