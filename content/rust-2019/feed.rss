This is mine.

There are lots of cool technical improvements to Rust that I want the project to achieve this year, and a few in particular that I’m definitely going to be putting a lot of time into. But this blog post is going to talk about none of them. Instead, I want to talk about organizational debt, and how badly the Rust project needs to deal with it in 2019.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">f0adf24b-6589-4306-a580-6cef894ad3b7</guid><pubDate>Mon, 16 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>withoutboats</dc:creator></item><item><title>Rust2019</title><link>https://medium.com/@softprops/rust2019-83ebfe46602e</link><description><![CDATA[It’s the time year to reflect on the past and to make wishful prospects for the future.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">1c724779-9e18-4c1a-94db-7799f444f6b3</guid><pubDate>Fri, 21 Dec 2018 05:47:42 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Doug Tangren</dc:creator></item><item><title>Rust 2019: Bootstrapping Minorities</title><link>https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/rust-2019-bootstrapping-minorities/9053</link><description><![CDATA[As a response of https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/12/06/call-for-rust-2019-roadmap-blogposts.html 3 for tooling improvement.

We have added a lot of great features since 1.0, but we need to address the warts that we have had for a long time. I mostly echo sentiments from Jonathan Turner, Nathan Vegdahl, and many others in my ‘fallow-year’ sentiments. Overall, Compilation speed and generic constants are my two most wished-for features. On top of that, I would like to see more ecosystem work to make embedded applications more feasible and easy to use. Finally, Rust needs a moratorium on adding syntactic sugar for 2019.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">9e8f8e34-8fe9-4b4b-b40a-970e0a85a993</guid><pubDate>Wed, 12 Dec 2018 08:10:44 -0500</pubDate><dc:creator>Davis Ross Silverman</dc:creator></item><item><title>Rust 2019 - It&apos;s the Little Things</title><link>https://blog.cessen.com/post/2018_12_12_rust_2019_its_the_little_things</link><description><![CDATA[This might be an uncommon opinion—especially among those motivated enough to write a Rust 2019 post—but I actually think Rust is pretty much at a good place now. For the kinds of things that I want to do (e.g. my path tracer), there isn't much that Rust is lacking as a language. There are some fiddly things like "placement new" that could be useful, but nothing really major. And of course, well-designed new features are always welcome, they just don't seem particularly critical to me at this point. In other words, I'm pretty much satisfied. Mission accomplished, as far as I'm concerned. I think the rest is just polish. Just the little things.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">a884801e-f80b-4ea4-8441-a86c2c736086</guid><pubDate>Wed, 12 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Nathan Vegdahl</dc:creator></item><item><title>Rust 2019: Technical Debt, Continued Productivity, and Stability</title><link>https://gist.github.com/mark-i-m/2c3508ab7a9f2c48f634f0b5da3bb000</link><description><![CDATA[I hope this post doesn't come across as a laundry list of stuff to do. Mainly, I consider a lot of this to be technical debt, and I would like to see it paid down a bit. Most of them also happen to be pain points that I have come across in my own usage of Rust, so perhaps I'm biased!

In case you missed it, we released our second edition of Rust this year! An edition is an opportunity to make backwards incompatible changes, but more than that it's an opportunity to bring attention to how programming in Rust has changed. With the 2018 edition out of the door, now is the time to think about the next edition: how do we want programming in Rust in 2022 to be different to programming in Rust today? Once we've worked that out, lets work backwards to what should be done in 2019.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">4259e940-d508-4de3-8971-3c3df7b30f98</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Dec 2018 04:34:31 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Nick Cameron</dc:creator></item><item><title>Lokathor&apos;s Rust 2019 wishpost</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/a4ygji/lokathors_rust_2019_wishpost</link><description><![CDATA[Recently I've been using Rust for GBA development (repo link), and before that I spent most of my Rust time with Handmade Hero work (the actual repo is private to handmade hero backers, so that link is just the main website).

But even with a hundred plus posts that didn’t happen, so this year it’s the moment to speak up. I have used many different languages in past and when I started studying Rust at version 1.0 I was quickly impressed by its very good design, I was mostly in agreement with most of its design decisions, despite every useful language has a messy implementation. Even small things were designed with care. And I loved how much Rust cares for code correctness. I prefer to avoid long debug sessions and to use more time in the design and coding phases. So I’ve kept learning and using it ever since. For 2019 and beyond I’d like Rust to keep working on finishing its many unfinished parts.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">db72fed1-63a5-41eb-868f-716f694cd52e</guid><pubDate>Sun,  9 Dec 2018 11:38:40 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>leonardo</dc:creator></item><item><title>Rust 2019 — let us pursue composability</title><link>https://medium.com/@GolDDranks/rust-2019-let-us-pursue-composability-70f1eb2238c3</link><description><![CDATA[We should drive home the goals set in spirit of productivity in 2019.

So here’s my take. I’ll start by looking back at the last year.

It’s unlike anything I’ve ever seen. Not only are we seeing an ever-growing number of big name users of Rust, we also continue to see leaps in productivity and functionality. Yesterday, the Rust 2018 edition shipped. The culmination of three years of work, it shows off what the community is capable of: new features, backwards compatibility, new ergonomics without sacrificing performance, and the list goes on and on.

Which is why it might comes as a little bit of a surprise that I suggest we let the field rest for the year. More specifically, that we should let one field rest while we plant another. Rather than focusing on new designs, I suggest we turn our attention outside of RFCs to other areas of Rust.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">8f026251-f6df-4816-a89f-855741aacbf6</guid><pubDate>Sat,  8 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Jonathan Turner</dc:creator></item><item><title>A simple agenda for the Rust Game Development WG</title><link>https://medium.com/rustgamedev/a-simple-agenda-for-the-rust-game-development-wg-485cfc72b088</link><description><![CDATA[Proposing Amethyst as our flagship project.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">e7334cc0-fe8a-4b16-b96f-c25b2073dc52</guid><pubDate>Fri,  7 Dec 2018 23:51:48 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Erlend S.
