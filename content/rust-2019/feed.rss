This is mine.

There are lots of cool technical improvements to Rust that I want the project to achieve this year, and a few in particular that I’m definitely going to be putting a lot of time into. But this blog post is going to talk about none of them. Instead, I want to talk about organizational debt, and how badly the Rust project needs to deal with it in 2019.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">f0adf24b-6589-4306-a580-6cef894ad3b7</guid><pubDate>Mon, 16 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>withoutboats</dc:creator></item><item><title>Security as Rust 2019 goal</title><link>https://medium.com/@shnatsel/security-as-rust-2019-goal-6a060116ba39</link><description><![CDATA[The goals and 2019 roadmap of Rust Secure Code Working Group]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">2785bcea-bff1-46c3-913b-87888f79133c</guid><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jan 2019 18:20:42 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Sergey Davidoff et al.</dc:creator></item><item><title>Rust in 2019: Security, Maturity, Stability</title><link>https://tonyarcieri.com/rust-in-2019-security-maturity-stability</link><description><![CDATA[2018 marked my second year as a full-time Rust developer, and I’m happy to say it’s the first year I shipped production Rust applications. Thus far these applications have been unproblematic, quietly and efficiently doing their job, and just as boring and predictable as I’d hope they’d be. I would like to hope my experience is repeatable, and that 2019 is the year that Rust can transcend the notion of being a bleeding-edge science experiment and instead settle down into being a “boring in a good way” practical language with a growing community developing and deploying production-quality software.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">f262d079-9126-4b48-ad7c-9c29105c16fe</guid><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jan 2019 23:37:32 -0800</pubDate><dc:creator>Tony Arcieri</dc:creator></item><item><title>Non-Web Embeddings for Rust Wasm 2019</title><link>https://medium.com/wasmer/non-web-embeddings-for-rust-wasm-2019-7b290e94f81d</link><description><![CDATA[The Rust Wasm team has made tremendous progress in building robust developer tooling for Rust targeting WebAssembly on the Web in 2018.

A new edition was released, progress on stabilising Rust’s asynchronous I/O story was made, a new website was launched, and so much more!

I was taking a graduate-level Reinforcement Learning and MDP class at the time, and shortly after transitioned to using it in my research in AI. Rust has a lot going for it in terms of package management, speed, and typing.

Unfortunately, it falls apart in several fundamental areas when it comes to mathematical and scientific uses. Some of these are ecosystem problems (i.e. the work just isn't there) and some of it are more core problems (e.g. type-level numerics, which will be solved Soon™, hopefully).]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">5059354d-87d1-41e8-9f5d-79f6e62cea41</guid><pubDate>Sat, 12 Jan 2019 03:10:53 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Zoe Juozapaitis</dc:creator></item><item><title>Rust 2019: Solid Foundations for Unsafe Code</title><link>https://www.ralfj.de/blog/2019/01/12/rust-2019.html</link><description><![CDATA[I think in 2019, we should make a coordinated effort to improving the foundations for writing unsafe code. Of course my particular Rust bubble is mostly about unsafe code, as you will know if you have read some of my previous posts – but safety is a core value proposition of Rust, and the entire ecosystem rests on a foundation of crates that make heavy use of unsafe code, so I believe that caring about unsafe code is an important piece to Rust’s overall success.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">03ffa23c-960c-4ca4-9de6-2ab39088fab5</guid><pubDate>Sat, 12 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Ralf Jung</dc:creator></item><item><title>Technolution Rust 2019 Roadmap</title><link>https://www.technolution.eu/en/about-us/news/279-technolution-rust-2019-roadmap.html</link><description><![CDATA[We rely on Rust. So do our customers, sometimes without even knowing it. We build software that is installed on devices that go out into the world, sometimes never to be seen again in years or even decades. But 15 years from now, we may get a request to make a change to that software.

Historically we have been very successful doing just that, first in C and later in Java. Slowly but steadily, we are coming to rely on Rust to be able to create maintainable mission-critical software for our customers.

Therefore our proposal for the 2021 roadmap: Reliability.

This blog post reflects on our journey up to the 2018 edition and outlines our view on Rust's progression in the coming years.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">761f2490-5d60-424a-868c-84efd9b171c8</guid><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Technolution B.V.</dc:creator></item><item><title>Stability → Productivity → Maintainability</title><link>https://medium.com/@tom.kaitchuck/stability-productivity-maintainability-9179f4b3e23f</link><description><![CDATA[Rust in 2019 and beyond: In response to the call for blog posts on the direction Rust should take in 2019 and beyond I’ve come up with a few ideas.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">ca3c5e56-62c9-4f06-a652-9dd666e7c61e</guid><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jan 2019 01:27:31 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Tom Kaitchuck</dc:creator></item><item><title>Rust 2019: security</title><link>https://snf.github.io/2019/01/10/rust-2019-security/</link><description><![CDATA[The problem is now that if we are measuring safety of Rust according to safe vs unsafe, the most obvious metric to optimize for is amount of unsafe lines in the code.

Personally I think this is a very profound thought, that the goal of a programming language is to help others to do and achieve things they never thought possible.

JavaScript empowers developers by being accessible - everyone can start and succeed quickly. It’s great. Rust on the other hand empowers developers by giving them the tools to go deep.

Let’s unpack that.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">36f876cd-8e90-4399-bec5-1e7b4883b95b</guid><pubDate>Tue,  8 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Claus</dc:creator></item><item><title>Rust in 2019: Focus on sustainability</title><link>http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2019/01/07/rust-in-2019-focus-on-sustainability/</link><description><![CDATA[To me, 2018 felt like a big turning point for Rust, and it wasn’t just the edition.

Procedural macros are great because they enable Rust to do more, without baking a lot of potentially domain-specific information into the language. For example, automatic serialization of data types 5 and expressive, type-safe abstractions for web servers 6 can both be implemented using procedural macros.

However, while expressive, procedural macros can’t do everything.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">5b89867c-1a66-4b88-ab28-5b04e6cda3f5</guid><pubDate>Sun,  6 Jan 2019 01:17:43 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Elliott Slaughter</dc:creator></item><item><title>Scientific Rust #rust2019</title><link>https://blog.luizirber.org/2019/01/05/rust-2019/</link><description><![CDATA[The Rust community requested feedback last year for where the language should go in 2018, and now they are running it again for 2019.

There's been a lot of talk of the Fallow Year and limiting new features, and I think these are great ideas. With that in mind, a goal that follows along those lines is to "Beat C++."

Buckle up, we’re gonna cover a lot of things, and a lot of it is not fun. This is definitely one of those, “We really need to look at ourselves in the mirror” hard truths posts. As I type this though, I’ve reflecting on the past few years with the Rust community I’m just in awe of the amount of work, dedication, and passion that’s gone into it. I started Rust when I was still starting my career and finishing up my CS degree and now we have a brand spanking new edition! So much has changed that it’s honestly mind boggling thinking about it. Even at work I gave a history of Rust presentation and it was wild being able to go “back in the day” for something that was just a regular day a few years ago.

Now I find myself thinking about the problems we face as we become an even bigger community. We have a lot of problems. They’re good problems to have, but problems that must be solved eventually. I’m gonna go through all of them, what I see as major pain points/issues we’ve solved up to now, the present problems, and ones on the horizon. I’ll cover what I think we should focus on in the upcoming year and where we can go towards for Rust’s 2nd Edition.

My first encounter with Rust was pre-1.0 (early 2015) and I immediately saw that Rust would be my future, wherein I joked to colleagues that I’d use it to “make toasters talk”. Followed by a sizeable hiatus (lack of personal time), I came back mid-year 2018. I can say for certain that the focus on usability and ergonomics was successful. Rust is much easier to use now than it was then. Rust format (rustfmt), Rust language server (RLS), text editor support, cargo tooling, compiler messages, and ecosystem crates’ quality and diversity are all amazing. The community is crazy diverse (first language learners, experienced systems people, web-dev people, programming language theory people, etc…). The chaos is well-managed with self-organizing working groups.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">53e4c3d4-a70a-4caa-a4c8-17be048c93df</guid><pubDate>Fri, 28 Dec 2018 16:49:44 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Josh Bowles</dc:creator></item><item><title>My Wish List For Rust 2019</title><link>https://haurchefant.fr/posts/2018/12/my-wishlist-for-rust-2019/</link><description><![CDATA[For the first time, I’m writing for the Rust Roadmap blog posts call.

Being relatively new at Rust, I am also of this generation that started immediately with Edition 2018. I switched to nightly very early on, and recently have been porting some code back to stable (1.31.x). I am overall very satisfied with Rust, but sometimes I come across something that doesn't work as I hoped. Every time that happens, I discover there is work-in-progress solving these issues, including, most of the time, a merged RFC, a nightly implementation behind feature gates or at least some blogs from core developers. Many time, the work I come across is from many years back.

I have read several #Rust2019 and I want to use this opportunity to agree with those that suggest to finish current core stuff.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">055bf639-2649-43e8-8604-91388b069c98</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Dec 2018 19:03:55 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Simon Chemouil</dc:creator></item><item><title>Rust 2019: Ignorant Thoughts</title><link>http://www.russet.org.uk/blog/3207</link><description><![CDATA[I’ve written a single library in Rust, called Horned-OWL for manipulating OWL.

There are some fiddly things like "placement new" that could be useful, but nothing really major.

I have used many different languages in past and when I started studying Rust at version 1.0 I was quickly impressed by its very good design, I was mostly in agreement with most of its design decisions, despite every useful language has a messy implementation. Even small things were designed with care. And I loved how much Rust cares for code correctness. I prefer to avoid long debug sessions and to use more time in the design and coding phases. So I’ve kept learning and using it ever since.

The culmination of three years of work, it shows off what the community is capable of: new features, backwards compatibility, new ergonomics without sacrificing performance, and the list goes on and on.

Which is why it might comes as a little bit of a surprise that I suggest we let the field rest for the year. More specifically, that we should let one field rest while we plant another.

All the while being vastly easier to learn, and to use correctly and efficiently at the same time.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">a3f673ea-49c8-4942-96a3-8565d6191ec5</guid><pubDate>Thu,  6 Dec 2018 21:06:21 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Hadrien G.</dc:creator></item><item><title>2019 Roadmap?
