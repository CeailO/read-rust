OpenWhisk supports a lot of languages out of the box and can be extended to use other languages. In our case, we are going to use Rust as our main primary language.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">784ce8bf-55af-48fc-9893-23f28a38c999</guid><pubDate>Fri, 22 Mar 2019 13:41:31 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Roberto Díaz</dc:creator></item><item><title>Packaging up a Rust Binary for Linux</title><link>https://dorianpula.ca/2019/03/15/packaging-up-a-rust-binary-for-linux/</link><description><![CDATA[How does one package a Rust app? I would check out creating a snap package (https://t.co/UYibrbPN7c). It worked alright for me, even though the format encourages sandboxing of apps which takes a bit to wrap your mind a bit.

The catch is that there are some rough spots on Azure Pipelines and in the rust ecosystem, but everything can be worked around. In writing this post, I hope to detail examples one can copy and paste into their projects.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">5288ae7c-b0a5-4e98-b6ad-512af05f04e4</guid><pubDate>Thu, 28 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Nick Babcock</dc:creator></item><item><title>Serverless Rust: Revisited</title><link>https://medium.com/@softprops/serverless-rust-revisited-f2c79f4039bb</link><description><![CDATA[A refreshing new story for running Rust on AWS Lambda.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">164aa143-a832-491e-b1c0-304913959b8d</guid><pubDate>Sat, 22 Dec 2018 15:43:04 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Doug Tangren</dc:creator></item><item><title>Azure Functions written in Rust</title><link>https://robertohuertas.com/2018/12/22/azure-function-rust/</link><description><![CDATA[A few days ago, we discussed how to write AWS Lambdas in Rust.

Read more details about the features and architecture of the Firecracker VMM at Firecracker Design.

Firecracker microVMs improve efficiency and utilization with a low memory overhead of < 5 MiB per microVMs. This means that you can pack thousands of microVMs onto a single machine. You can use an in-process rate limiter to control, with fine granularity, how network and storage resources are shared, even across thousands of microVMs. All hardware compute resources can be safely oversubscribed, to maximize the number of workloads that can run on a host.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">50e86e16-57e4-4740-8251-b7eb6340d9ad</guid><pubDate>Tue, 27 Nov 2018 05:02:08 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Arun Gupta</dc:creator></item><item><title>Running Rust natively in AWS Lambda and testing it locally</title><link>https://medium.com/@bernardo.belchior1/running-rust-natively-in-aws-lambda-and-testing-it-locally-57080421426d</link><description><![CDATA[Abusing Go runtime in AWS to run Rust binaries]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">97715a00-432f-4cfa-9c11-92f0d74ff60e</guid><pubDate>Mon, 12 Nov 2018 14:23:33 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Bernardo Belchior</dc:creator></item><item><title>Rust Nightly, Travis CI and Code Coverage</title><link>https://baptiste.gelez.xyz/~/Rust/rust-nightly-travis-ci-and-code-coverage/</link><description><![CDATA[How to setup test a Rust Nightly project with a workspace in Travis CI and collect coverage information with kcov and Codecov.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">b49cc876-bb7e-4861-a0d6-34b4396b3600</guid><pubDate>Thu,  1 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Baptiste Gelez</dc:creator></item><item><title>Plumbing the Deps of the Crate: Caching Rust Docker Builds</title><link>https://mgattozzi.com/caching-rust-docker-builds/</link><description><![CDATA[Learn how to cache your Docker builds with Rust better so you don't keep downloading and building your deps over and over and over again!]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">96f12355-f732-45f5-9ca2-d2e68bc741ab</guid><pubDate>Tue, 23 Oct 2018 03:32:10 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Michael Gattozzi</dc:creator></item><item><title>korq: Kubernetes Dynamic Log Tailing Utility</title><link>https://vertexclique.github.io/korq/</link><description><![CDATA[K∅RQ is used for tailing pod logs concurrently and following groups at once.

Rather than list all the various offerings in this space, I'll refer you to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, in particular the interactive Landscape.

You can either deploy existing functions or create new ones. If you create new ones, there's a big list of officially supported languages. Alternative you could turn a CLI into function.
