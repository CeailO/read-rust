This is what I was hoping to accomplish: strongly typed server-side and client-side languages (Rust & Elm respectively), push-button deployments to the cloud with free hosting initially, and sub-second response times for API calls and page loads. With this setup, I think I'm well on my way to accomplishing each of these.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">f8a137b7-ce7d-4553-bcec-6170350dc1f2</guid><pubDate>Sun, 24 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Ethan Frei</dc:creator></item><item><title>Even faster rust builds in Gitlab CI</title><link>https://vadosware.io/post/even-faster-rust-builds-in-gitlab-ci/</link><description><![CDATA[tl;dr - I applied a few patterns Iâ€™ve used on other projects to a Gitlab CI-powered rust project to achieve <2min builds. Basically just caching at different layers â€“ caching via the docker image builder pattern at the docker level, aggressive caching with Gitlab CI at the CI runner level, also one more step of combining some build steps (probably unnecessarily).]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">451beac2-903e-4bff-ada5-dc478a19e2c1</guid><pubDate>Wed, 30 May 2018 17:09:59 +0900</pubDate><dc:creator>Vados</dc:creator></item><item><title>Setting up gitlab-ci for Rust</title><link>https://not.plhk.ru/gitlab-ci-rust/</link><description><![CDATA[We're going to create a multi-stage pipeline based on the one I'm using at work, featuring: a build image, linting, test & release builds, and docker containers]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">5b534e6e-4e12-4860-95d6-1317b8903d4e</guid><pubDate>Mon, 14 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Alexander Polakov</dc:creator></item><item><title>Building and Deploying Rust with VSTS</title><link>https://blog.x5ff.xyz/blog/rust-ci-cd-vsts/</link><description><![CDATA[Since I started at Microsoft about 6 months ago, I had to catch up on their (our) tech: Azure, .NET, Visual Studio. Yet as an avid GitHub user I overlooked one thing completely: Visual Studio Team Services!
