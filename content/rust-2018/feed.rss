This is frustrating for someone new because you just want to get your task done and not have to first research a whole other area. I realized that the more valuable route for me would be in improving documentation and tooling to serve as living documentation.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">a9de17fb-57cf-442a-988c-8ab1ec79b3db</guid><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jan 2018 04:20:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Ed Page</dc:creator></item><item><title>Rust 2018: Core, Embedded+SIMD, Intermesiate documenation, Async • r/rust</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/7syxw4/rust_2018_core_embeddedsimd_intermesiate/</link><description>Hi there!

Reflecting 2017 2017 was an amazing year for Rust. We got 8 releases of rust itself! We got basic procedural macros allowing custom derive (also known as “macros 1.1”) in the first release last year (1.15.0).

I found myself in pretty much complete agreement with Nick Cameron’s post, so I thought instead I would write about my own personal goals for Rust in 2018. I am fortunate enough to work on Rust full-time; modulated by the work that needs to get done to accomplish larger team goals, these are some things that I’m individually very motivated to make progress on in 2018.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">bd4a7ce1-c702-4965-b9c4-01e0ffca352b</guid><pubDate>Tue,  9 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>withoutboats</dc:creator></item><item><title>Looking back at Rust in 2018 • Steve Klabnik</title><link>http://words.steveklabnik.com/looking-back-at-rust-in-2018</link><description>A careful reader will note the date of this post; it’s fundamentally in response to this call for blog posts, with a rhetorical device of looking backwards as if my personal plans for Rust came true.

Before getting started, I’m very appreciative of the hard work put into the overall Rust community and ecosystem, including the behind-the-scenes work. It’s difficult to understate just how much time and energy people volunteer in pursuit of a better, Rust-ier world.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">6e9f2101-5cff-4356-95ea-43146f207fc5</guid><pubDate>Sun,  7 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Matthew Mayer</dc:creator></item><item><title>#Rust2018 blog post</title><link>https://gist.github.com/cessen/394829673855e56157f63b4447f91e67</link><description>#Rust2018 blog post</description><guid isPermaLink="false">dbe7f7e3-229a-4d77-8d9f-7d857c051b54</guid><pubDate>Sun,  7 Jan 2018 06:23:37 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Nathan Vegdahl</dc:creator></item><item><title>Improving how we improve Rust in 2018</title><link>http://www.jonathanturner.org/2018/01/rust2018-and-data.html</link><description>The past few years, I’ve been lucky to be part of the Rust community survey process.
