As a community, we've achieved great things but we should take care not to crumble under the weight of a scaling language and ecosystem.

We do have some good projects like ndarray, RustSim, uom, etc. but we definitely need more (some stuff is also mentioned here Not-Yet-Awesome Rust).

A new crate is better than a lot of new stuff in the standard library.

Fun times!

Of course, things have changed a lot since then. The language has stabilized and we have Rust Editions to rely on for major releases. However, even though changes to the language are backwards compatible, there is still quite a lot of churn due to new features being added.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">d06968c3-bc41-4dda-966b-e46850d76549</guid><pubDate>Thu,  7 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Andy Grove</dc:creator></item><item><title>Rust focus for 2020</title><link>https://gist.github.com/starkat99/32fd5156e5c744c30dde61e82ed7bcd9</link><description><![CDATA[In response to Rust's call for blogs about Rust development in 2020, here's a few of my own thoughts: Improve Error ergonomics, Stabilize existing approved features, Stabilize more ecosystem libraries.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">7d25a259-4131-4a03-8d9a-cea51b7790cb</guid><pubDate>Wed,  6 Nov 2019 19:07:44 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Kathryn Long</dc:creator></item><item><title>Rust 2020: Funding</title><link>https://fasterthanli.me/blog/2019/rust-2020-funding/</link><description><![CDATA[Blog posts that praise Rust are many but funding is generally in short supply.

Then I will indulge in some rumination on the nature and necessity of roadmaps. Finally I'll make some probably obvious points in a long-winded way. Tl;dr, money is a thing we need to think about, async programming and WASM are important, and the compiler should be faster.

It really amazes me how the team hears everybody and how friendly the community is.

I have been learning rust for more than a year already, but this year was the first where I tried to write something real and production ready with it.

I haven't been incredibly involved in the development of Rust in the last few months, (navigating the delicate balance of being self employed, working on free software and not burning out) but I feel like that might change again.

In particular, it would be great if OS developement could finally be done on stable rust. Things like inline asm are blocking this. I think there is still a great deal of technical debt left over. I'll talk more about this later. It's not clear what the right balance of new features and working on technical debt is.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">3ece4d28-616e-4ea1-b182-f194738e220f</guid><pubDate>Wed, 30 Oct 2019 14:27:23 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>mark-i-m</dc:creator></item><item><title>Rust 2020</title><link>https://insanitybit.github.io/2019/10/30/rust-2020-wishlist-stabilize-the-ecosystem</link><description><![CDATA[In 2019 the big focus was async/await, or at least as an outsider that is how it has appeared. The end result looks like it will deliver what we’ve all been waiting for - efficient async code that works well with Rust’s borrow checker. As 2019 is coming to a close and async/await is stabilizing, there is the obvious question - what next?]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">071c6a14-46cc-468f-a9c7-fd456360ffe9</guid><pubDate>Wed, 30 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>InsanityBit</dc:creator></item><item><title>My Wishes for Rust 2020</title><link>https://cetra3.github.io/blog/rust-2020/</link><description><![CDATA[2019 was another huge year for rust, but instead of implementing the shiny new thing, it's been a focus on refining existing ideas. Having being using rust professionally for over 3 years, I feel I will very soon be regailing new rust developers of the times before NLL & async, where we had to play lexicon-fu to get things like caches to work in a reasonable fashion, or using super dooper combinator chains and wrestling with futures types (Either::A/B anyone?). So I'd like to make clear my acknowledgement that I am happy with the direction that the rust language is heading in, and these requests are really nice to haves.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">96de766f-57ab-48b5-a1ad-97c4fe3d67eb</guid><pubDate>Wed, 30 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Cetra</dc:creator></item><item><title>Rust 2020: exploit dominance in web assembly and no_std</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/dp1omc/rust_2020_exploit_dominance_in_web_assembly_and/</link><description><![CDATA[I'm a no name who's just grateful to play around with Rust. The most exciting aspects of Rust is seeing a expressive language go where other languages can barely tread (wasm,linux kernels, microcontrollers). I hope Rust continues to be the bleeding edge tech in web assembly land. I would dream for a world where Rust team works closely with browsers and what new wasm features will drop, and Rust is first to get it. no_std, async, and alloc have added a lot of fascinating new capabilities to the wasm ecosystem, i'd love to see some aspects get stabilized in this realm.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">a9a47fee-f918-46f1-bd89-5ddbcbd69f32</guid><pubDate>Wed, 30 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>u/richardanaya</dc:creator></item><item><title>Rust 2020 – More Or Less</title><link>https://llogiq.github.io/2019/10/30/rust-2020.html</link><description><![CDATA[The Rust team asked for 2020 roadmap blog posts, so here goes: Let’s do more of what we’ve been doing so far.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">71a819be-cc9f-43fc-bc00-a9c182229efc</guid><pubDate>Wed, 30 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Llogiq</dc:creator></item><item><title>Rust 2020: Private enum variants</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/dov6ox/rust_2020_private_enum_variants/</link><description><![CDATA[For the 2021 edition of Rust, I'd like to see private enum variants.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">1b2c0d1d-3b43-444e-8755-e8e4a60cb2b7</guid><pubDate>Wed, 30 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>u/joshlf_</dc:creator></item><item><title>My Rust 2020 blog post</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/dot5pk/my_rust_2020_blog_post/</link><description><![CDATA[The 2019 goals for the Rust project were to finish some old language and library features that have had a lot of design but have not been pushed through the finish line.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">86590c31-b27d-4d59-b6d8-23eaae5c3dac</guid><pubDate>Wed, 30 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>u/0b_0101_001_1010</dc:creator></item><item><title>A call for blogs 2020</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/dorinl/a_call_for_blogs_2020/</link><description><![CDATA[Comments on the call for blog posts in 2020 on Reddit, some of which include 2020 wishes.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">a32d1a1c-6453-4222-b0a6-9a7f996f6864</guid><pubDate>Wed, 30 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Commenters on Reddit</dc:creator></item><item><title>Vision for Rust 2020 - Integration</title><link>https://www.hardmo.de/article/2019-10-29-rust-2020-vision.md</link><description><![CDATA[With async close the completion everything looks to fall perfectly in place for maintaining the developer momentum that Rust has picked up.

One big question for this year: will there be a Rust 2021 edition? If so, 2020 would be the year to do a lot of associated work and plan the details.

As far as I can tell we the Rust Community are doing a great job, and I just want us to keep doing what we’ve been doing. My biggest worry is that the people who contribute the most are dangerously close to burning out and I made a tweet much to that effect.

But I was talking with someone recently about what makes Rust great, the language and the community, and that ultimately boiled down to how inclusive and accessible we are, and it made me think saying more than just “keep doing what we’re doing and take care of yourselves” is in order.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">73ca1a48-6e45-48f0-a06d-dd09bedd9d9f</guid><pubDate>Thu, 12 Sep 2019 13:40:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Jane Lusby</dc:creator></item></channel></rss>
