I believe the future of systems programming is likely to be in Rust. I am certainly invested in the Rust language. Last month I resigned from my job writing embedded C, so I could start my own company, producing IP Networking software in Rust.",

I believe the time is right for a native GUI toolkit written in Rust, and that such a thing would fill a very important niche. There is a demand for performance (which, to me, includes startup time, RAM footprint, and binary size), and Rust is in the best position to deliver on that.",

Probably, for the web, or a desktop application, or a mobile application; because that’s largely what many developers are building today.",

Having being using rust professionally for over 3 years, I feel I will very soon be regailing new rust developers of the times before NLL & async, where we had to play lexicon-fu to get things like caches to work in a reasonable fashion, or using super dooper combinator chains and wrestling with futures types (Either::A/B anyone?). So I'd like to make clear my acknowledgement that I am happy with the direction that the rust language is heading in, and these requests are really nice to haves.",

I hope Rust continues to be the bleeding edge tech in web assembly land. I would dream for a world where Rust team works closely with browsers and what new wasm features will drop, and Rust is first to get it. no_std, async, and alloc have added a lot of fascinating new capabilities to the wasm ecosystem, i'd love to see some aspects get stabilized in this realm.",
