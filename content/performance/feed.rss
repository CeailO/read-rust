Given this goal, you might be surprised to learn that Finda is built with Electron, a framework thatâ€™s often decried for being the opposite of fast.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">655ac748-e1e9-4fa4-b12a-2dc7c2e88fa7</guid><pubDate>Sun, 18 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +1100</pubDate><dc:creator>Kevin J.

It provides precise measurements of changes in the performance of benchmarked code, and gives strong statistical confidence that apparent performance changes are real and not simply noise. Clear output, a simple API and reasonable defaults make it easy to use even for developers without a background in statistics. Unlike the benchmarking harness provided by Rust, Criterion.rs can be used with stable versions of the compiler.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">5e5df82f-aba3-4832-bbe6-e995b2e544ef</guid><pubDate>Mon,  5 Feb 2018 07:00:00 -0600</pubDate><dc:creator>Brook Heisler</dc:creator></item><item><title>Benchmark of different Async approaches in Rust</title><link>https://vorner.github.io/async-bench.html</link><description>The story about Rustâ€™s async is still a bit in flux. Thereâ€™s a bunch of libraries with their pros and cons and different approaches. Even Iâ€™m a bit to blame for that, as Iâ€™m writing one of my own, called Corona.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">1ccb8993-1118-4eb4-a1fb-0c6146948662</guid><pubDate>Sat,  3 Feb 2018 11:16:55 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Michal &apos;vorner&apos; Vaner</dc:creator></item><item><title>Faster Progress Report 2</title><link>https://adamniederer.com/blog/faster-pr-2.html</link><description>faster began as a yak shave, created to aid baseðŸ’¯ in its quest to become the fastest meme on Github. Writing an explicit AVX2-accelerated version of baseðŸ’¯&apos;s encoder and decoder, then realizing I&apos;d have to do the same thing again to see the speedups on my Ivy Bridge desktop, pushed me to make this library. Months later, it has blossomed into its own project, and has eclipsed baseðŸ’¯ in both popularity and promise.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">e1a29851-ab4c-4739-a41f-56e9c783f5e4</guid><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jan 2018 22:14:41 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Adam Niederer</dc:creator></item></channel></rss>
