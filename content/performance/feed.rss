There is much exploration, and a number of promising projects, but I also think we don’t yet know the recipe to make GUI truly great. As I develop my own vision in this space, druid, I hope more that the efforts will learn from each other and that an excellent synthesis will emerge, more so than simply hoping that druid will win.

In my work, I have come across a problem that is as seemingly simple, yet as difficult to get right, as making decent tea: handling smooth window resizing. Very few GUI toolkits get it perfect, with some failing spectacularly. This is true across platforms, though Windows poses special challenges. It’s also pretty easy to test (as opposed to requiring sophisticated latency measurements, which I also plan to develop). I suggest it become one of the basic tests to evaluate a GUI toolkit.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">1898399d-d60a-46fc-a3e0-cb8a73fb546e</guid><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jun 2019 19:50:42 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Raph Levien</dc:creator></item><item><title>On Memoization in Rust</title><link>https://medium.com/swlh/on-memoization-291fd1dd924</link><description><![CDATA[A detailed walk through how to memoize function calls in Rust.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">b26fcca3-2a79-4340-88fd-80c6f70c95d1</guid><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jun 2019 12:30:14 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Andrew Pritchard</dc:creator></item><item><title>Speed Up Your JavaScript With Rust</title><link>https://medium.com/paloit/speed-up-your-javascript-with-rust-7661922562fa</link><description><![CDATA[For a recent personal project, I had only needed a fairly simple node.js server to do exponential and costly computing tasks.

Often, generics aren’t really needed for speed, but for ergonomics: Library code might want to present an easy-to-use generic interface that will automate some conversions. However, this often means that almost each user gets their own version of the code, leading to the aforementioned bloat (case in point: Earlier clap versions were notorious for adding hundreds of kilobytes to the binary size – for a simple command line parser).]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">568fdc54-427f-47be-8849-dd040bafe8dd</guid><pubDate>Sat, 18 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Llogiq</dc:creator></item><item><title>Using Rust to Scale Elixir for 11 Million Concurrent Discord Users</title><link>https://blog.discordapp.com/using-rust-to-scale-elixir-for-11-million-concurrent-users-c6f19fc029d3</link><description><![CDATA[Over the last year, the Backend Infrastructure team at Discord was hard at work improving the scalability and performance of our core real-time communications infrastructure.

One of the most surprising things I found was in the implementation of insert. It was doing something that was so offensive to people who care about collection performance that we had designed an entire API to help people avoid it: it did two lookups in the map.

But, as a data scientist, it’s still hard to use Rust on a daily basis. 90% of my programming these days is in Python.

My interest in Rust-based machine learning sparked several months ago. But, the key limitation I found was the lack of an ergonomic linear algebra library. There’s nalgebra and ndarray and a few others. Yet, I found none of them at the time ergonomic to work with, nor fast in comparison to writing the lower-level SIMD, BLAS, and Lapack code (I have picked up ndarray more in recent weeks and months).

While inconvenient, a few months later, I’m glad I had to take things a step further. Rust is great for writing performant code. The resources for writing quite low-level mathematics operations in Rust are quite good. Using blas-src and lapack-src, as well as Rust’s built in SIMD functions, we can write fast and surprisingly portable Rust code. You can even run Rust on the GPU using, at least, the same underlying code.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">d937feae-59ca-4312-bd40-dc77317e441a</guid><pubDate>Sat, 16 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Erik Partridge</dc:creator></item><item><title>From 48s to 5s - optimizing a 350 line pathtracer in Rust</title><link>https://medium.com/@cfsamson/from-48s-to-5s-optimizing-a-350-line-pathtracer-in-rust-191ab4a1a412</link><description><![CDATA[In this post I’ll talk about how to port a short raytracer written in C#/C++ codebase to Rust, then applying some simple optimizations by leveraging some features in Rust.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">ca80053b-f874-4631-9f13-c8ffaf6dabd6</guid><pubDate>Mon,  4 Mar 2019 23:03:25 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Carl Fredrik Samson</dc:creator></item><item><title>Fearless concurrency: how Clojure, Rust, Pony, Erlang and Dart let you achieve that</title><link>https://sites.google.com/a/athaydes.com/renato-athaydes/posts/fearlessconcurrencyhowclojurerustponyerlanganddartletyouachievethat</link><description><![CDATA[several models that make it easier to reason about concurrent programs have been envisioned over time.

However, as others noted, the comparison was fairly limited. It didn't compare Rust's implementation to other implementations, such as glibc's strtod or Go's ParseFloat. The parser I implemented wasn't correct, it led to rounding error for most representations, by using floats for intermediate values. Furthermore, the comparisons used data unlikely to be encountered in real-world datasets, overstating the performance differences by forcing Rust to use slower algorithms. So, naturally, I aimed to address all these concerns. And finally, I forgot to disable CPU scaling, meaning CPU throttling could have led to inconsistent benchmarks.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">f848772a-4132-4e4f-b817-c4a6dec365b7</guid><pubDate>Sun, 16 Dec 2018 08:39:39 +1100</pubDate><dc:creator>u/ialex32_2</dc:creator></item><item><title>The Swiss Army Knife of Hashmaps</title><link>https://blog.waffles.space/2018/12/07/deep-dive-into-hashbrown/</link><description><![CDATA[A while back, there was a discussion comparing the performance of using the hashbrown crate (based on Google’s SwissTable implementation) in the Rust compiler.

A single day of request logs is usually around 500 gigabytes on disk. So every day, we generate about 500 files that are 85MB on disk, and contain about a million streaming JSON objects that take up 1GB when uncompressed.

That actually needs two distinct things from the language. First, is it shouldn’t introduce too much (preferably zero) overhead for its abstractions and be fast out of the box. Many people coming from the high level languages (python, javascript, …) find this to be the case ‒ just type the program, compile it (with --release) and it’s reasonable fast. The other, no less important, is allowing the programmer to tweak some knobs when trying to squeeze a bit more speed out of the program.

I’ve decided to test the second a bit and see how far I could go. I’ve chosen matrix multiplication as a case study, for several reasons. I’ve played with it before (in my master’s thesis), it’s relatively simple and the effects of optimizing it can be great. For simplicity, I’ve decided to multiply only square matrices with power-of-two sizes, but these restrictions can be lifted in a real implementation without significantly loosing performance ‒ only the code gets somewhat more complex and hairy.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">d18e865c-71c2-4c7e-85ff-7d84e1999055</guid><pubDate>Sat, 12 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Michal &apos;vorner&apos; Vaner</dc:creator></item><item><title>How a Rust upgrade more than tripled the speed of my code</title><link>http://troubles.md/posts/the-power-of-compilers/</link><description><![CDATA[I’d like to share a quick story about the sheer power of LLVM and the benefits of using higher-level languages over assembly.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">97a47f42-b32a-45df-8473-892b94367048</guid><pubDate>Fri, 11 May 2018 16:07:31 +0200</pubDate><dc:creator>troubles.md</dc:creator></item><item><title>Optimising CTree and strs</title><link>http://blog.jeffsmits.net/compsci/2018/05/08/optimising-stratego-core/</link><description><![CDATA[Once upon a time, I wrote an interpreter for Stratego Core in Rust, which I named strs.

At Chain, we (Henry de Valence, Cathie Yun and Oleg Andreev) have been working on a pure-Rust Bulletproofs implementation, whose initial version we are publishing today, together with a set of notes.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">d412d980-cc59-4a0b-ab9e-19100f3b8927</guid><pubDate>Fri, 13 Apr 2018 19:21:27 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Chain</dc:creator></item><item><title>New sysinfo version (huge performance improvements!)</title><link>https://blog.guillaume-gomez.fr/articles/2018-04-09+New+sysinfo+version+%28huge+performance+improvements%21%29</link><description><![CDATA[This new version comes with great performance improvements.

Their use-case was basically to receive an as-high-as-possible number of audio RTP streams over UDP, transcode them, and then send them out via UDP again. Due to how GStreamer usually works, they were running into some performance issues.

This blog post will describe the first set of improvements that were implemented for this use-case, together with a minimal benchmark and the results. My colleague Mathieu will follow up with one or two other blog posts with the other improvements and a more full-featured benchmark.

The short version is that CPU usage decreased by about 65-75%, i.e. allowing 3-4x more streams with the same CPU usage. Also parallelization works better and usage of different CPU cores is more controllable, allowing for better scalability. And a fixed, but configurable number of threads is used, which is independent of the number of streams.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">98f65a4a-8501-45e4-bda8-48d5d01306ba</guid><pubDate>Thu,  5 Apr 2018 15:21:06 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Sebastian Dröge</dc:creator></item><item><title>Speeding Up &apos;dwarfdump&apos; With Rust</title><link>https://robert.ocallahan.org/2018/03/speeding-up-dwarfdump-with-rust.html</link><description><![CDATA[Writing a debugger for C++ on Linux, you spend a lot of time examining pretty-printed DWARF debug information using tools like readelf, objdump or dwarfdump. Unfortunately this can be quite slow.

I decided to try to speed dwarfdump up. TL;DR: I reduced the dump time from 506s to 26s by fixing some simple issues and taking advantage of Rust "fearless parallelism". I think there are interesting opportunities for speeding up many kinds of command-line tools using Rust and parallelism.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">3052579c-dccc-46b8-8d93-bbecfa493992</guid><pubDate>Thu, 29 Mar 2018 14:44:00 +1300</pubDate><dc:creator>Robert O&apos;Callahan</dc:creator></item><item><title>Rust + Node.js are awesome!</title><link>https://itnext.io/rust-node-js-are-awesome-a50d63411773</link><description><![CDATA[Blazing fast, low requirements, computationally intensive operations on Node.js using Rust]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">07825eb3-aaab-46c5-b7e4-680857d73750</guid><pubDate>Tue, 27 Mar 2018 21:50:20 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Benjamín Calderón</dc:creator></item><item><title>Building a fast Electron app with Rust</title><link>https://keminglabs.com/blog/building-a-fast-electron-app-with-rust/</link><description><![CDATA[When I built Finda, I wanted it to be fast — specifically, to respond to all user input within 16 milliseconds.

It provides precise measurements of changes in the performance of benchmarked code, and gives strong statistical confidence that apparent performance changes are real and not simply noise. Clear output, a simple API and reasonable defaults make it easy to use even for developers without a background in statistics. Unlike the benchmarking harness provided by Rust, Criterion.rs can be used with stable versions of the compiler.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">5e5df82f-aba3-4832-bbe6-e995b2e544ef</guid><pubDate>Mon,  5 Feb 2018 07:00:00 -0600</pubDate><dc:creator>Brook Heisler</dc:creator></item><item><title>Benchmark of different Async approaches in Rust</title><link>https://vorner.github.io/async-bench.html</link><description><![CDATA[The story about Rust’s async is still a bit in flux.
